            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Authours Addreſs TO HIS SISTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Deareſt Siſter,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce God would ſo have it that I ſhould partake with you of the goods of Nature, and that our common Birth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us not to have any thing of Particular in the advantages of the World; I hope he will pleaſe to accept the deſire I have to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this right to the Goods of
<pb facs="tcp:150342:4"/>Grace, and that he will approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of my making you partaker of what I could gather in the Books of the Church, whereby I have reſerved nothing from a perſon whom he hath rendred ſo dear unto me.</p>
            <p>Nor can I believe that the World it ſelf, notwithſtanding that it is accuſtomed to diſapprove the doings of them who have abandoned it, can condemn this. For if people take it not amiſs, that ſuch as love one another by motives of Intereſt, and for the Goods of this life, ſhould make uſe of theſe Goods to give pledges of their love to one another: why ſhould it be any wonder, that they who are linked together by
<pb facs="tcp:150342:4"/>a friendſhip which is totally diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from the Senſes, ſhould employ Spiritual things to teſtify reciprocally to each other their true affection.</p>
            <p>Imagine not therefore, my Siſter, that this Book is the effect barely of a natural Love, which gives me entrance into all your Intereſts. I am excited to write unto you by more holy and more powerful motives: it is no longer lawful for me to act meerly by them of Nature. And having drained all that this Work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from the Well of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, and from the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers of the Church, I may aſſure you that I have the leaſt ſhare therein.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150342:5"/>
            <p>You therefore are not to make any Reflection upon him who preſents it unto you; but apply it to your ſelf ſingly for the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Soul with the Virtues which are here diſcovered unto you, and which God demands of a Chriſtian Mother.</p>
            <p>Conſider, that you can give him no greater proofs of your Love and of your Fidelity, than to bring up your Children accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of the Goſpel and the Counſels of the Fathers of the Church; and that you cannot offer to him a ſacrifice which will better pleaſe him, than to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them to him by a holy Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſince they are the better part of your ſelf: nor is there any
<pb facs="tcp:150342:5"/>thing which can more move him to pour forth upon you and upon them his bleſſings, than the care you ſhall take to inſtruct them in his Fear and in his Love, and to let all the World ſee, by engaging them to imitate their Heavenly Father, that you look upon them as his Children.</p>
            <p>'Tis to help you in this laudable deſigne, that I have begged of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo much light as was neceſſary for me, to obſerve in the ſacred Scriptures and in the Volumes of the Fathers of the Church, thoſe Maxims which ought to be followed in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of children: that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beſought him to inſpire me with ſuch choice Advices as he
<pb facs="tcp:150342:6"/>would have me draw from thence to propoſe them to you, if he would pleaſe to make uſe of me, altogether unworthy as I am, to give you the knowledge of what your children ſtand in need of, and of his deſigns upon you and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>Conſider then, if you pleaſe, this little Work, as a Collection of what is moſt holy and moſt pure in the Doctrine of the Church, touching the Subject it treats on. I have done no more than joyn the paſſages to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, And if there are ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions the Authours whereof are not cited, it is becauſe they were included in the Principles which I have eſtabliſhed upon the
<pb facs="tcp:150342:6"/>authorities of theſe great Saints.</p>
            <p>Nothing now remains, but to ſend up to God my Prayers, that what I have done to diſcharge my Conſcience, may not make yours criminal: but rather that he will effect by his Grace, that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in practiſe theſe wholſome Maxims and Advices which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you, you may happily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> avers, <hi>That the health and happineſs of Children turns to the Glory and to the Advantage of their Fathers and Mothers.</hi>

            <head>THE Authours Advice TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THis Treatiſe of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> was Compoſed Eight or Nine Years ſince by a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for one of his Siſters, who was engaged in Marriage. He only propoſed to himſelf in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, to aſſiſt that perſon in particular, and to inſtruct her
<pb facs="tcp:150342:7"/>how ſhe ſhould worthily acquit her ſelf in one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Obligations of the eſtate to which God had called her, which was, to bring up her Children in the Fear and love of God. But in proceſs of time, this Treatiſe having been ſeen by ſeveral of his Freinds, who judged it very proper to be made publick; the Reſpect and Submiſſion he had to their Opinion, obliged him to apply himſelf to render it fit for all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he added ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and many Maxims, which he conceived might be to them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; and in general he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to accomodate to all ſorts of
<pb facs="tcp:150342:8"/>conditions, and to all manner of perſons, whatever is herein contained.</p>
            <p>He hath moreover ſtudied to preſent to all Fathers and to all Mothers, certain Rules, which they may obſerve in the ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Children; and it may be ſaid, That if they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they ought, to the Truths propoſed to them in this Book; they ſhall finde all that can contribute to render their Childrens Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conformable to the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>They who are not yet enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Marriage, may here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo learn with what ſpirit they ought to undertake that State of life, and how great, difficult,
<pb facs="tcp:150342:8"/>and ſublime are the Obligations thereof.</p>
            <p>They who have renounced the State of Marriage to embrace that of Religion, may here finde great ſubjects to praiſe God; in that he hath not permitted them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a condition, wherein it is ſo hard to acquit themſelves of their duty.</p>
            <p>Finally, all they who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the Education of Children, and who conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do hold the Places of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and of Mothers over them, ſhall here ſinde the lights and ſuccours, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to acquit themſelves as they ought.</p>

            <p>Some perhaps will judge that we have too much deſcended into particulars in ſome places: but the Authour conceived, that his deſigne being to preſcribe Rules, not of Speculation but of Practiſe, he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too far into the particulars; and that he himſelf ought to make ſome application of the Maxims he propoſes, to the end they might more eaſily be reduced into Practiſe by ſuch as have a minde to follow them in the conduct of their Family.</p>
            <p>It is to be hoped that God will beſtow his bleſſing upon this Book, becauſe a very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care hath been taken that
<pb facs="tcp:150342:10"/>it ſhould contain nothing which is not drawn from the two moſt pure Fountains of Truth, which are; <hi>The Sacred Scripture, and the Works of the Church-Father.</hi>

            <p>THe Education of Children, is one of the things of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the World. The Pagans looked upon it as the only good of the Common-Wealth; they applied thereto all their cares, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Books upon this ſubject which are not the leaſt conſiderable of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Which notwithſtanding, one may ſay, that all their Solicitude, and all their diligence proved unprofitable: They ſought a good which was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to diſcover: The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Paganiſm hindred them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Virtue: and in inſtructing others, they could never frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any other than a groſs Idea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and a ſhadow far diſtant from the Verity. But the School of Chriſtianiſm ought to be repleniſhed with Maſters much more clear-ſighted, and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:150342:11"/>by the Lights which ſhine from the Fire enkindled in the Souls of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by the Grace of Chriſt Jeſus. The ſacred Scriptures and the works of the Fathers furniſh the Matter and Form to make people truly good: and there may be found all the precepts which are neceſſary to inſtruct Fathers and Mothers in what they ought to teach their Children. The Author of this Treatiſe is aſſuredly of the number of theſe excellent Maſters: His Piety and his Learning ſparkle out (without Oſtentation) in all the paſſages of his Book. We have read it with all poſſible exactneſs, and we judge it very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and very neceſſary to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Given at <hi>Paris,</hi> the 24 of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 1666.</p>

               <head>The Preface.</head>
               <p>NOthing is more common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men then Marriage, and nothing is more unknown then the Duties of this ſo common a condition: The <hi>major</hi> part of them who engage themſelves therein look only on its outſide, and on that which it hath of carnal and terreſtrial, and they do not at all inform themſelves either of the obligations which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, or of the extreme difficulties there are to acquit ones ſelf Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein. They embark themſelves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150342:17"/>and enter upon this voyage of their whole lives, without knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go, or what courſe they are to ſtear: and contracting an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable alliance with a ſtrange per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſcarcely known him, who muſt be not only the Companion of their happineſs or unhappineſs in this life, but who muſt be one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſes thereof, both in this life, and for all Eternity.</p>
               <p>To embrace ſolemnly a Regular life under the Obedience of a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our choſen among many for his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and for his good qualities, there muſt be at leaſt a year of triall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Ordinance of the Church: but to have a Maid rank her ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obedience of a Husband, and take upon her the charge of a Family, (which requires almoſt the ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Religious perſon, and the prudence of a Superiour), they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that no time is too ſhort; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe kinde of affairs in the ſpace of a Month or Fifteen days,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150342:17"/>without making reflection upon the diſpoſitions and upon the qualities the perſons have to acquit themſelves of theſe Duties.</p>
               <p>Yet when they are once engaged, there is no more means left to give back. They muſt keep on to the end of their earthly pilgrimage, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the duties of their condition, or renounce their ſalvation. They may well repent themſelves of the raſhneſs of their engagement, but they are no longer free to change it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who finde themſelves thus tyed up, ſeeing that God forbids them to diſengage themſelves, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that 'tis his will they ſhould remain in that State, in whatever manner they entred into it; and that they ſhould ſincerely apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to know and to practice that which he demands and expects of them.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of theſe Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the light of God gives to ſome Souls, which are thus engaged
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150342:18"/>without having maturely conſidered of it, is for them in ſome ſort the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Vocation. For if one cannot ſay that they were called to the State of Marriage, yet one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but that at leaſt they were called in Marriage; and that ſuffices to move them to remain therein in peace and repoſe, according to the advice of St. <hi>Paul: Let every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Vocation and in the State to which God hath called him,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20.</p>
               <p>All then they have to do, is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to adore the deſignes of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to content themſelves with the meaſure of grace he gives them; and by not hiding from themſelves the difficulties and the obligations of their State, to reſolve to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh faithfully whatever God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them.</p>
               <p>Now if the perſons who have ſlieghtly engaged themſelves in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are obliged not to hide from themſelves the Difficulties and the Obligations of that Eſtate: they who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150342:18"/>as you, my Siſter, have not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, but after many Prayers and ſerious Reflections; may they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them without being unfaithful to the lights and to the graces by which God hath made them conceive the Hope of being ſanctified therein, by accompliſhing the things which he exacts of them?</p>
               <p>Wherefore to be in a condition to practice them yet more perfectly then you perchance have done hitherto; you muſt quit all humane ſentiments and feelings, and raiſe up your ſelf above all the low and carnal aſpects which people have ordinarily of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to the end you may enter into the ſentiments of Chriſt Jeſus, and into the deſignes he had in exalting this humane alliance to ſo high a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Excellency of Chriſtian Marriage.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ONe of the principal reaſons which induced the Saviour of the world to place ſo great a dignity upon the humane alliance of Marriage, was the will he had to ſanctify by this means the generation of Children, and to give to married perſons the neceſſary graces to apply themſelves holily to their Education. For, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerves,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt.</hi> l. 1. <hi>de Nupt.</hi> c. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The will of faithful people not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating it ſelf in Marriage only to put Children into the world to dye; but to the end that they being born again in Chriſt Jeſus, may receive eternal life:</hi> how could they have acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this Duty with greater eaſe, than in receiving (when they contract this holy alliance) the particular grace which our Lord hath annexed to it, and which he hath merited for them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150342:19"/>by his Paſſion? 'Tis by this grace that Marriage hath been re-eſtabliſhed in its firſt dignity, from which it was fallen after ſin, in the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And as the holy Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſays; <hi>'Tis by it, that the natural love, (which married perſons bear to one another,) hath been perfected, that the iudiſſoluble uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their hearts hath been ſtrengthned, and that all their actions have been ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 2d. Motive which induced Chriſt Jeſus to raiſe the Marriage of Chriſtians to the dignity of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was, that he might give us an exteriour and ſenſible ſigne of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love he bears us, and of the ſtrict Union he hath contracted with the Church which is his Spouſe: ſo that the principal glory of them whom he unites by this ſacred knot, is the honour they have to repreſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unto us this Divine alliance. This is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> admirably expreſſes in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſiaus</hi> in ſuch terms as I could wiſh could
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150342:20"/>be engraven in the bottom of your heart, and which I conjure you to keep continually in your Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let the Wives,</hi> (ſays this Apoſtle) <hi>be ſubmitted to their Husbands as they are to God: for the Husband is the Head of the Wife, as Chriſt Jeſus is the Head of the Church which is his Body, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is the Saviour. Wherefore as the Church is ſubmitted to Chriſt Jeſus, ſo Women ought to be ſubmitted in every thing to their Husbands: And you Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, love your Wives as Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath loved his Church, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered himſelf to death for her, to the end he might ſanctify her after he had purified her by the Word in the Water of Baptiſm, and that ſhe might appear before him full of Glory, having neither blemiſh, nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch like thing, but being holy and irreprehenſible. Thus Husbands ought to love their Wives as their own Bodies. He who loves his Wife loves himſelf; for no one hates his own Fleſh, but nouriſhes it, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it as Chriſt Jeſus doth his Church,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150342:20"/>becauſe we are the Members of his Body, making a part of his Fleſh, and of his Bones. And 'tis for this that it is ſayd in the Scripture, that a man ſhall aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Father and his Mother to live with his Wife, and that of two which they were, they ſhould become one ſelfſame Fleſh.—Thus let every one of you love his Wife as himſelf, and let the Wife reſpect and honour her Husband,</hi> Eph. 5.22. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You ſee by this, my Siſter, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> makes a continual Parallel of Jeſus Chriſt and of his Church with the Chriſtian Bridegroom and his Spouſe; that he concludes the Duties of the Wife towards her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the Duties of the Husband towards his Wife, of the Submiſſion which the Church hath for Chriſt Jeſus, and of the Grace which Chriſt Jeſus communicates to his Church; and that he gives no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idea or Form of the mutual Love or Fidelity which they owe to one another, and of the indiſſoluble
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150342:21"/>Union which ought to be between them, than the Love which Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath for his Spouſe, than the Fidelity which this holy Spouſe hath for Chriſt Jeſus, and than the Union which he would have with the Church by rendring her his Body.</p>
               <p>Muſt we not then aver after this great Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.32. That ſurely <hi>Marriage is a holy Inſtitution in Chriſt Jeſus and in his Church:</hi> and that <hi>it is honourable in all,</hi> Heb. 1.4. that is to ſay, as the holy Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate it, in all its parts.</p>
               <p>Yes, my Siſter, you ought to have a high eſteem of the ſtate to which God hath called you, becauſe in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it was he who having drawn <hi>Eve</hi> from the ſide of <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt Father, gave her to him for his Spouſe; 'tis alſo he who by his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hand hath tyed the knot of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred cord of your Marriage, and who gave you to your Husband.</p>
               <p>You ought to do it, becauſe God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to multiply Souls which may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150342:21"/>bleſs and praiſe him to all Eternity, hath done you the favour to make choice of you to cooperate by the production of your Children and by their Education to ſo great a work.</p>
               <p>You ought to do it, becauſe Chriſt Jeſus by his preſence at the Marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> has ſanctified all them which are to be celebrated among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>You ought finally to do it, not only becauſe there are ſo many holy perſons in the Old and New Teſtament who have lived moſt faintlike in Marriage, but alſo becauſe the Mother of Chriſt Jeſus the moſt pure and moſt innocent of all creatures was engaged in the bonds of that indiſſoluble alliance which you have contracted, In ſuch ſort that if by the Vow of Virginity which ſhe made before the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Salutation, ſhe was (as S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> relates) the model of all the Virgins who were to come after her;
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> lib <hi>de Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate.</hi> c 4. <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>contra Julianum.</hi> c. 22.</note> ſhe was no leſs (in the opinion of the ſame holy Father)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150342:22"/>the example of Married perſons, by eſpouſing St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and by powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſinuating unto them by her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct, that Marriage ceaſes not truly to ſubſiſt, although by mutual conſent they ſhould propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to live in a holy Continence.</p>
               <p>But above all, my Siſters, you ought to eſteem your ſelf happy, in that your Marriage is the Sacrament and the image of that of Chriſt Jeſus with his Church; in that he hath permitted you, and even ordained you to conſider your Husband as the Church doth Chriſt Jeſus, to have for him all the tenderneſs and all the Submiſſion you are capable of, as the Church hath for Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; to leave your ſelf to be conducted by his Spirit, as the Church leaves her ſelf to be conducted by the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, to enter into all his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions &amp; into all his ſentiments, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with him of all his pains &amp; all his afflictions, as the Church doth them of Chriſt Jeſus; and not to wear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ornaments, nor make uſe of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150342:22"/>affected dreſſes but as far forth as he permits you, as the Church hath no more ſplendour and glory than what Chriſt Jeſus communicates unto her.</p>
               <p>Now if the Patriarks and the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites eſteemed themſelves very much honoured in having Children, becauſe the people of God were thereby much augmented; that they hoped the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> might be born of their blood; and that they might perhaps have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of affording him a Father or a Mother: what Glory may not you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by furniſhing to Jeſus Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Mercies, and by putting into the World Children who may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Members and the Brothers of the Son of God? However you will merit this Glory, my Siſter, and at the ſame time will acquit your ſelf of the principal Duties of the ſtate wherein you are ingaged, if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſelf ſeriouſly to give your Children a truly Chriſtian and Holy Education, having firſt laid aſide the falſe Lights and pernicious Errours,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150342:23"/>which are the cauſe why the <hi>major</hi> part of Fathers and Mothers neglect the Education of their Children, and that they have no other <hi>Idea's</hi> than ſuch as are altogether Carnal, and as remote from the excellency of the eſtate to which they are called, as Heaven is from Earth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>That the Education of Children is one of the moſt conſiderable employs of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm: And of the firſt Errour which makes it to be neglected, which is, the mean Idea Parents have of the Chriſtian Life.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat which makes Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ordinarily a low <hi>Idea</hi> of the Education of their Children, is, that they themſelves have a very mean <hi>Idea</hi> of the Chriſtian Life.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150342:23"/>of children, becauſe they have not for them any more noble &amp; more hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick aims than they have for themſelves</p>
               <p>It is therefore neceſſary, in order to know what it is to Educate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Chriſtianly, that it be underſtood in the firſt place what it is to live Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly; and above all it is neceſſary to be rid of an Illuſion which deceives the greateſt part of the World, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading it ſelf that none but Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons are called to Sanctity; and that the common Life of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hath nothing that is labourious or painful.</p>
               <p>To convince you of the contrary, it ſufficeth, my Siſter, to make you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the ſtate of Chriſtianiſm is a ſtate of Sanctity and of Innocency; that all they who make profeſſion thereof, ought according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the Goſpel, <hi>to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as their Heavenly Father is perfect; Mat.</hi> 3.48. and as
<note n="*" place="margin">Chryſoſt. <hi>cont. vit. vitae. Mon.</hi> l. 3.</note> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well obſerves, that there ought to be no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150342:24"/>other difference between the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and them who live in the World, but only that theſe engage themſelves in the bonds of Marriage, whereas the Religious conſerve all their Liberty, and have great advantages above Married perſons for the more eaſy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the promiſes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>And that no doubt may remain in your ſpirit concerning this point, and that you may entirely baniſh from thence this firſt Errour, which cauſes all the irregularities that ſlide into the manners of Chriſtians; I will here ſimply tranſlate what this great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Greek Church hath written in one of his Works, which he adreſſes to a faithful Father of Children.</p>
               <p>This great Saint, after he had made appear, that perſons engag'd in the world are no leſs obliged than the Religious to obſerve exactly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Chriſt Jeſus which he hath given us in the Goſpel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no diſtinction in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150342:24"/>Words, and that for example he hath abſolutely forbidden to Swear, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Wife of ones Neighbour with criminal deſires, concludes, that all the other Precepts of the Goſpel, which are not addreſſed to one particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate which is there expreſſed, extend themſelves commonly to all the world: and that by conſequence our Saviour having declared in general, that true Happineſs conſiſts in Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit and in Tears, in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt after Juſtice, in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and Sufferings; and that the Rich and ſuch as live in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things, in the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements and applauſes of the world, are truly unhappy; it is no more permitted to ſeculars than to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to fancy or acknowledge any other fountains of happineſs then Poverty &amp; Tears, Contempt and Sufferings; and that all Chriſtians ought equally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Riches, Pleaſures, &amp; Honours, as the moſt probable cauſes of their perdition.</p>
               <q>Thus, adds he, this diſtinction
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150342:25"/>which is put between perſons living in the world and them who renounce it, is a meer invention of men. The holy Scripture knows it not, but will have all Chriſtians, and even them who are engag'd in Marriage, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame Rules and the ſame Inſtitute as do the Religious. Hearken to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, and when I name St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is as if I produc'd to you the words of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf. This great Apoſtle writing to married perſons who labour in the Education of their Children, doth he not require of them all the exactneſs and all the perfection of a retired and ſolitary life? For doth he not cut off from them all the pleaſures they might take, either in the ornaments of cloathes, or in the delicateneſs of drinking and of eating, when he ſays: 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 2.9. <hi>Behold the order I give you as to what concerns the Women; I deſire that they ſhould be clad modeſtly, and that their manner of cloathing and dreſſing themſelves may breath nothing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150342:25"/>but decency and chaſtity: that they wear no frizled hayr, nor ornaments of Gold or of Jewels, nor ſumptuous habits; but that they be cloathed as may beſeem Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who make profeſſion of piety and who ought to make their piety appear by their manners and actions.</hi> And when he adds in the ſequel ſpeaking of widows: <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. v. 5. <hi>She who lives in delights, is dead according to the ſpirit although ſhe be living according to the body.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, ſpeaking of all the faithful in general: <hi>Having what is needful to live, and wherewith to cloath our ſelves we ought to be content:</hi> could he exact any thing more of Religious perſons?</q>
               <p>After St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath thus run over all the Rules which St. <hi>Paul</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to Married people, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which he ordains them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; whether for their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which he not only forbids idle babling and the reciting of Fables and human Inventions, but moreover pleaſant fancies and immoderate gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whether for the Meekneſs and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150342:26"/>for the Charity which he enjoyns them to have towards one another, not ſuffering them to be tranſported in words againſt their Neighbour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and commanding them even to be ſo far affectioned to procure the good of all the World, as to abandon their proper Intereſts for the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace with their Brethren: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſay, that he had made it appear how St. <hi>Paul</hi> impoſes upon Married perſons ſuch Laws as the moſt ſolitary Monks have much ado to accompliſh: he adds the words following.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>What can we finde greater and more excellent than theſe Rules? And ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us to be above choler, clamours, deſires of Riches, of good cheer, of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence in Cloaths, of vain-Glory, and of other Pomps of the World; to have nothing to do with the Earth, and to mortify our Bodies: is it not evident that he requires no leſs perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in all Chriſtians, than Chriſt Jeſus required in his Diſciples? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150342:26"/>that he even ordains us to be ſo dead to ſin, as if we were effectually buried and really dead to the World.</p>
                  <p>But to make you ſee that it is the deſigne of the Apoſtle; mark that the moſt powerful Argument he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys to exhort Chriſtians to patience and Humility, is the obligation they have to render themſelves conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt Jeſus. Now if he doth not ordain us to take for the model of our Life the Religious, nor even the Apoſtles, but Chriſt Jeſus himſelf; and if he threatens with ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble puniſhments them who imitate not this amiable Saviour, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can any one have to pretend that there are States in Chriſtianiſm more obliging than others to tend to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and higher perfection, ſince it is commanded to all the world, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the ſelf ſame Salvation, that is to imitate Chriſt Jeſus? Behold that which undoubtedly overthrows the whole Univerſe. People imagine that none but Religious are bound to live
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150342:27"/>well, and that others may live negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, they are deceived, this is not ſo: but all the World is obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Maxims, and to enter into the ſame Reflections.</p>
                  <p>And fancy not, (ſays he), that it is I who advance this Verity: 'Tis Chriſt Jeſus himſelf who teaches it: 'Tis he who is to judge the whole World, and who will judge it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame Maxims; as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears by the rigorous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he pronounced againſt the wicked Rich man, who is not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, becauſe he being Religious was cruel, but who burns in the flames which ſhall never be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he had overmuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Pomps of the World, and that living in the abundance of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Pleaſures, and being covered with Purple and ſumptuous Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he deſpiſed and neglected to ſuccour <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was reduced to great miſery.</p>
                  <p>Surely when our Lord ſays, <hi>come to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150342:27"/>me all you who labour and who are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and I will eaſe you: Take my yoak upon you, and learn of me that I am meek and humble of Heart, and you ſhall find the reſt of your Souls;</hi> he ſpeaks not only to Religious perſons but to all ſort of people. When he enjoyns to enter into the ſtrait way, he lays not this command only upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, but equally upon all men. Jeſus (theſe are the proper tearms of the Goſpel) ſaid to all; <hi>If any one will give himſelf to me, let him renounce himſelf; let him dayly bear his Croſs; and let him follow me.</hi> And when he ſaid, that if any one came to him, and that he did not hate his Father and his Mother, his Wife, his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, his Siſters, and even his own Life, by deſpiſing all theſe things when there is queſtion of the ſervice and of the glory of God, he could not be of the number of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that is to ſay, Chriſtian; he did not except any Eſtate nor any Profeſſion; even as he excepted not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150342:28"/>any Father nor any Mother, when he ſaid, that he who loved his Son or his Daughter more than him was not worthy to belong to him.</p>
                  <p>I conceive then, (concludes this great Doctor), that no one will be ſo bold nor ſo contentious, as to dare to deny (after ſuch convincing proofs) that the Divine Laws do not equally oblige him who lives in the World, and him who is retired out of it, to the ſame perfection; and that in whatever eſtate Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans live, they are to beware of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into ſuch dangerous opinions as thwart theſe verities.</p>
               </q>
               <p>They who are thus perſwaded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, my Siſter, to comprehend how difficult a matter it is to educate Children Chriſtianly. For this Chriſtian Education conſiſting in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing them in a Chriſtian Life, it muſt deſtroy in them all that is oppoſite to this Life; as the love of Honours, of Pleaſures, and even of all unprofitable things. In ſuch ſort,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150342:28"/>that as in effect the Chriſtian Life of the common people of the World, ought not to be different from that of Religious perſons in the Interiour Virtues, which make the Eſſence of Chriſtian Perfection; it is alſo clear that in what concerns the ground of Virtue, the Education of Children ought not to be different from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Religious people, ſince in truth we are all Religious, of the General Religion of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

               <p>IF the mean <hi>Idea</hi> which Parents form to themſelves of the Chriſtian Life, and the ſmall feeling they have in their hearts of the great Purity to which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150342:29"/>this life obliges us, is cauſe of the little care they take in the Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſurely the falſe Imagination they have, that it is a ſmall matter to loſe ones Innocency, and that it is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, contributes alſo extreamly to make Fathers and Mothers ſlide into this dreadful negligence. And yet can there be a more horrible Infidelity than to violate one of the moſt holy and moſt inviolable alliances which God hath made with men, which is that of Baptiſm, by which we are initiated into Chriſt Jeſus? And what outrage commit we not againſt God, ſays <q>
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:150342:29"/>
               <p>This moved an ancient Father of the Church to <q>ſay, that if one falls after Baptiſm,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pacianus</hi> in <hi>Catech.</hi>
                     </note> he will be in worſe eſtate than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Baptized; becauſe the Devil will keep him faſter bound in his fetters as a fugitive ſlave whom he hath overtaken in his flight; and Chriſt Jeſus can no more henceforth ſuffer death for him; ſince he who is reſuſcitated from the dead, cannot any more dye.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This moved St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Hebrews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>That 'tis impoſſible for them who have once been illuminated, who have taſted the guift of Heaven, who have been rendred parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Holy Ghoſt, who have been nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with the ſacred word of God and with the hope of the happineſſe of the world to come, and who after this have fallen away, ſhould be renewed again unto Repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as much as in them lies they crucify the Son of God afreſh and expoſe him to open ſhame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This means not, my ſiſter, that there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150342:30"/>remains no hope of pardon for them, who having been once delivered by Chriſt Jeſus, re-ingage themſelves by their ſins in the ſervitude of the Devil; for it is moſt true, that Chriſtians ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning voluntarily after the knowledge of the truth, finde a Sacrifice of Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for their ſins: But it means that to obtain this pardon and deſerve to be again once more purified by the Blood of this innocent Victime, the ſinner muſt according to the language of the Fathers, pour forth not only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tears, but Tears of heart, which flow from a ſincere Repentance, and perform actions of ſtrong Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pennance above the Idea which people are wont to form of it. So that one may ſay, 'tis much more eaſy to conſerve the Innocency of Baptiſm, than to recover it by this means when one hath once loſt it. Beſides, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when one hath recovered it, there is ſtill as great a difference between ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners converted, and them who have conſerved the Innocence of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,

               <p>What then ſhould not Fathers and Mothers do to hinder their Children from falling into this dreadful miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? And ſince there is nothing but a Chriſtian Education which can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them; with how great zeal ought they to apply themſelves unto it?

               <p>And in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, Eccle.</hi> 30.3. <hi>He who well inſtructs his Son ſhall be praiſed in his perſon, and that he ſhall be the ſubject of his glory in the midſt of his Domeſticks and of his Friends. If he comes to dye,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:150342:31"/>adds he, <hi>it will ſcarcely appear, becauſe he leaves behinde him a Succeſſour who reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him. He hath had the happineſs and the comfort to ſee him himſelf in his life time, and at his death he hath no affliction or confuſion before his Enemies, becauſe he leaves a Son, who can protect his family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their inſults. and acknowledge the favours of his friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely, if reaſoning even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Maxims of the World, all the glory of a Father and of a Mother of a Family conſiſts in the ſettlement and good government of their Houſe, what is there more advantagious to Fathers and to Mothers, than to have Children well educated? Since accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Wiſe man, the prudence and the good conduct of Fathers ſhining in the manners of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nothing can more cauſe their memory to be honoured, than the good Education they have given them.</p>
               <p>What avails it to a Father, that he hath heaped up a vaſt quantity of Riches, that he hath made many
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150342:32"/>Freinds, and acquired much Wealth, if he leaves Children, who for want of good Education, will diſſipate all his goods in ſuperfluous and criminal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, and who will abandon all theſe Freinds to joyn themſelves to lewd perſons, and to ſeek out companions of their debauches and diſſolution? What comfort can he expect when he ſhall be ſeized on by the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of old age? And what help can he hope for in his Infirmities, from them who have not obeyed him, and who have ſleighted him when he was yet in the vigour of his days and could have made himſelf feared?</p>
               <p>But to make uſe of ſuch only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as Piety furniſhes us withall: what advantage can a Father draw from a Life all Innocent and Holy, if he be condemned by God for having neglected the Education of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? think not, that I of my ſelf do advance this aſtoniſhing propoſition. It proceeds from Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> who after he had made it moſt evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150342:32"/>
                  <q>That every one is no leſs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to procure to the utmoſt of his power the ſalvation of his Neighbour than his own, and that the negligence of other mens ſins, is the greateſt of all crimes, concludes, that they who ſhall have neglected the good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Children, ought with much more reaſon dread to be rigou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly puniſhed for that ſole ſin, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that otherwiſe they lead a virtuous and well regulated life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He proves this Verity by a Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, which is known to the whole world: 'tis that of the High Prieſt <hi>Heli,</hi> who was of himſelf a very good man, and who as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Diſaſters which befell him, had a great ſubmiſſion to the will of God, and a moſt ardent zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: but for having contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reprehend with meekneſs two very wicked Sons of his, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them the heynouſneſs of their crime without oppoſing himſelf with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150342:33"/>all the care and force as he was bound to do, drew down the indignation of God upon himſelf and his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. His two Sons were ſlain on the ſame day. The Wife of the elder of them loſt her life in the pains of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before her time. The Ark of the Covenant was taken by the Enemies, And he himſelf unable to ſupport ſuch ſad News, fell backward out of his Chair, brake his brain pan, and there died. So that forty years employed in the government of Gods people with all the juſtice and all the integrity ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, could not hinder <hi>Heli</hi> from periſhing in a miſerable manner, for having not laboured in the Education of his Children with that force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which God demanded of him. This Negligence defaced all his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucs, and obſcured all his brave acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And this ſin, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>could not be expiated in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of ages, either by Oblations or by Sacrifices.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this it may be ſeen, that Fathers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150342:33"/>and Mothers who neglect to chaſtiſe their Children, and to oblige them to ſerve God, render themſelves really their Parricides and Murtherers. For although theſe of this High-Prieſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now mentioned, were killed by the Enemies, yet it may be ſaid, that he was himſelf the prime cauſe of their Death, ſince his negligence in chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them diverted the ſuccour of God from them, and put them in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them who bereft them of their life. <q>'Tis thus, ſays St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that we our ſelves treat our Children with more Inhumanity, than Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would do; becauſe all their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty can extend it ſelf only upon the liberty of their bodies, whereas we by our evil conduct reduce their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the ſervitude of Vices, and ſuffering them to follow their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons render them bondſlaves to the Devil himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Can it then be wondred at, that God puniſhes with ſuch ſeverity the little care Parents have of the Education of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150342:34"/>their Children? and can we be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee ſo much rigour uſed towards them who are the cauſe of the crimes they commit, becauſe they did not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, nor ſtifled their paſſions in their birth: and furthermore, becauſe in the judgement of the ſame great Doctour, although theſe Children ſhould afterward come to acknowledg themſelves, and to get out of the way of Vice to walk in that of Virtue, and that by a pure effect of Gods Mercy they ſhould renounce the Maxims of the World to follow them of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; their parents will not nevertheleſs eſcape a moſt rigorous chaſtiſement, if they neglected their Education: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall be cenſured to have contributed as much as in them lay to their Childrens ruine and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now if faults which Parents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in this Education, draw upon them ſuch great evils; if in the ſentiment of all the holy Fathers and of all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, all the Imperfections and all the crimes which Children ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150342:34"/>by their negligence, ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them; and if their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are augmented proportionably as the ſame Imperfections and the ſame crimes ſhall be multiplied in them who deſcend from them; what Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry think you is prepared to crown the labours of ſuch Parents as had no other ambition than to have Chriſtian Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor other deſires than to imprint deeply in their ſoul the fear of Gods Juſtice, and the acknowledgement of his Mercy?</p>
               <p>But how much ſoever Fathers are intereſted in the Education of their Children, whether becauſe of the juſt apprehenſion of the Puniſhments which are prepared for them if they neglect it, or becauſe of the comforts both temporal and eternal which they hope from them if they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with care to their Education: yet 'tis of greater conſequence to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to ſay better, it is to them of the higheſt neceſſity.</p>
               <p>I inſiſt not upon this, that their Sex
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150342:35"/>being leſs proper to command, and that finding themſelves ſubject to great Infirmities in old age, they ought to have a greater care to inſtil into their Children even in their tender Infancy an acknowledgement and a reſpect for themſelves: I conſider here only their ſpiritual intereſt; and I ſay, that the means which a Mother hath to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy her ſelf are reduced in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Chriſtian Education of her Children.</p>
               <p>'Tis St. <hi>Paul</hi> who teaches us this Truth, when after he had ſpoken of the modeſty which Chriſtian. Women ought to uſe in their cloaths, and of the warineſs they ſhould obſerve in their Words, particularly in Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, as to what concerns points of Doctrine and the Interpretation of the holy Scriptures; he adds; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>They ſhall be ſaved by the Children they ſhall bring into the World, by procuring that they remain in Faith, in Charity, in Sanctity, and in a well regulated life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if he ſhould ſay to Chriſtian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150342:35"/>according to the explication of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> 
                  <q>My Siſters, do not thruſt in your ſelves to procure the glory of God and the ſalvation of your Neighbour by publick Inſtructions. A woman medled once only with teaching, and ſhe ruined the whole World: yet do not you afflict your ſelves for this miſchief, and let not your heart ſink at this reproach. God hath given you a means to repair this injury which you have all received in the perſon of the firſt Woman, and he preſents to you another occaſion to ſave your ſelves, to wit, the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Children, whom you ought to conſider as ſo many helps he affords you to arrive at his glory. <hi>Eve</hi> alone ſhall not be ſaved by the means of her Children, but all they of her Sex ſhall not gain Heaven but by the care they have taken in the Education of them whom God hath beſtowed on them, in Faith, in Charity, and Innocency.</q>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis upon this ground that the ſame
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150342:36"/>Apoſtle will have the firſt thing upon which Widows are to be examined, when they were to be choſen for the Churches Miniſtry, to be, <hi>In what manner they have educated their Children:</hi> As if the moſt evident mark of the Sanctity of a Mother, were that of her Children, and that it was needleſs to ſeek any other proof of her fidelity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and of her zeal for the good of the Church, but her fidelity and her zeal to ſee that the conduct and the converſation of her Children was ſolidly Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The foundation of all this is, that Children in their low age, are much more frequent with their Mothers than with their Fathers, and that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have right to repoſe themſelves upon them untill their riper years. And thus it belongs to them to watch particularly over their Children in their Infancy, as from whom God will demand a more exact account of theſe years, the moſt important of our lives. As Children have almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150342:36"/>their Mothers before their eyes; may we not preſume that they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they have ſeen them do, that they have entred into all their ways; and to make uſe of S. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> terms, <q>that 'tis as it were by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they are become their likes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And moreover ſince nothing can be hid from Mothers concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Inclinations of their Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been witneſſes of all their cries, of all their plays, and of all their motions: may one not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuſtice attribute to them all the unhappy effects which have followed the Paſſions that they ſuffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in their hearts; and are they not cauſe of the crimes which they hindred them not to commit, by not oppoſing themſelves to the bad cuſtomes which they contracted under their government?</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Wherein particularly conſiſts the Obligation which Parents have to endeavour the Chriſtian Education of their Children.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHat we have hitherto ſaid, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhews the Obligation which Fathers and Mothers have to labour with care to beſtow on their Children a Chriſtian Education; ſince we have made it manifeſt that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation is one of the principal Duties of perſons engaged in Marriage, and that they are highly obliged, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Mothers to be very careful and faithful therein. But becauſe one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too clearly convinced of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; we muſt, my Siſter, more fully eſtabliſh it, by ſhewing that it is that which God particularly exacts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>To be perſwaded of this, there needs no more, but to conſider on one ſide the ſubmiſſion of wills to Fathers and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150342:37"/>Mothers, wherein God will have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to live; the feelings of love and acknowledgement which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to have for them; and the recompences he promiſes them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to honour them: and on the other ſide, the Authority which he gives Fathers and Mothers over their Children, and the rigour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he revenges the contempt they receive of them.</p>
               <q>It was not enough, ſays St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> that God in the deſigne he had to recommend to parents the good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of their Children, imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their heart a natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhould ſo powerfully draw them, as that they could not without uſing violence to themſelves diſobey him; he would moreover that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould have great reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their parents, thereby to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more dear and more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that their Obedience and their Love might be as ſo many charms which ſhould allure them to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150342:38"/>take ſpecial care of them in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</q>
               <p>And ſince nothing more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engages us not to neglect buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than the confidence they have in us, and the abſolute power they give us: could God impoſe a ſweeter neceſſity upon Fathers and Mothers in regard of their Children, than in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them their Maſters; and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting them with their Education to imprint on their foreheads the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is neceſſary to ſucceed therein?</p>
               <p>By revenging ſo ſeverely the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done by Children to them who brought them into the World, and puniſhing them with death when they offend them; doth he not ſollicit them, not only to educate them in the fear and in the ſubmiſſion they owe to them, leſt Juſtice ſhould take them from them; but moreover to nouriſh them in the reſpect and in the fidelity which they owe to him, who is truly their Father? And what a confuſion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150342:38"/>muſt it needs be to parents, to ſee that God hath taken ſo much care to hinder their Children from affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and that they have taken ſo little care that theſe ſame Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be hindred from treading under their feet his Commandements and his Ordinances?</p>
               <p>But if that which God hath done in favour of Parents, permits them not to neglect this Education, that which he hath done for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doth not leſs indiſpenſably oblige them to employ therein all their Vigilancy and their whole induſtry. What then? The Son of God ſhall annihilate himſelf for their love; he ſhall have laboured ſo many years, and ſuffered ſo many torments to ſanctify them; and Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would not humble themſelves to inſtruct them, or uſe the leaſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to themſelves to form them in Virtue? He who needs no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made himſelf poor, and rendred himſelf obedient even to death, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150342:39"/>to give them example, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to contemn the World, and to labour for Eternity: and they whoſe very Salvation is advanced by the means of their Children, ſhall they not think of ſhewing them the way to Heaven, and endeavour to withdraw them from that which leads them to eternal puniſhments?</p>
               <p>He hath made them members of his Body in order to make them partakers of his Glory: and they who have had the happineſſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this good for them, ſhall they not take care to procure for them all the Spiritual Health and all the neceſſary proportion to encreaſe in Chriſt Jeſus who is their Head, and to receive from him by being united to him the encreaſe which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, to all the parts of his Body, by the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his influence?</p>
               <p>Certainly there's nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt nor more puniſhable than this conduct, nor is there any thing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150342:39"/>which Fathers and Mothers ought not to do to avoid it. They are to educate for God their Children, as he commands them, becauſe his ſole poſſeſſion can make them happy.</p>
               <p>They ought to do it, becauſe the exactneſs of his Juſtice will render them reſponſable for all the faults theſe their Children ſhall commit by their negligence. They ought to do it, becauſe their labour ſhall receive infinit bleſſings from God himſelf.</p>
               <p>But above all they ought to do it; becauſe thereby they will cut off, as much as in them lies, the ſource of all the evils which are done in the World, which is bad Education, and they will thereby re-eſtabliſh the ſource of all good and of all Virtues, which is good Education.</p>
               <p>Finally, is it not this good Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which prepares the Spirits to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the cleareſt lights, and which plants in the Soul the firſt diſpoſitions to all the Virtues? Is not that it which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150342:40"/>ſpreads in the hearts the ſeed of the moſt heroick actions, and which lays the Foundations of all that which muſt appear beſt to the eyes of the whole World in the ſucceſſion of ages? It fills the Courts of Princes wih faithful, generous, and disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed Subjects; the Parliaments with firm and unbiaſſed Magiſtrates and Judges; Colledges with Religious Perſons, and Secular families with prudent and charitable Maſters, and with reſpectful and ſubmiſſive ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. In fine, it is the good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which augments the myſtical Body of Chriſt Jeſus, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats the number of the Elect and of the Bleſſed.</p>
               <p>There's nothing but it which can baniſh all the Vices reigning now in the World; becauſe there's but it alone which can imprint in it dread and horrour. 'Tis it only which can make the ſpirit of Poverty flouriſh again, by exciting in the Hearts which it informs, a contempt of all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150342:40"/>creatures. 'Tis by it alone that the love of ſufferings may be re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed among Chriſtians, by baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the yet-tender Bodies the eaſes and delicacies of the World, and accuſtoming them timely to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. 'Tis it alone which can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Order, and retain Inferiours in reſpect and ſubmiſſion to their temporal and ſpiritual Superiours, in uſing them to the practice of an exact Obedience: 'Tis it alone which can revive charity and zeal towards our Neighbour, by inſinuating into them an eſteem and a tenderneſs to all the World. Laſtly, there's nothing but it, that is capable to change the whole face of Chriſtianiſme, to produce a happy Reformation in all the Church, to preſerve Children in their Innocence and in the grace of Baptiſm, and to trace in the Life of Men a lively Image of the all-holy and all-divine Life of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

               <p>I Cannot better in my judgement expreſs to you, my Siſter, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and ſentiments in which you are obliged to labour in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of your Children; than to conjure you to conſider them as goods which God depoſes in your hands, and which belong not at all to you.</p>
               <p>You will finde no difficulty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon theſe thoughts, if you well examine that you have no ſhare of that which is in them moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that is to ſay, of their ſouls: that what you communicate to them in regard of the Body, is nothing but what you received from your Anceſtors; and that even to ſpeak juſtly, they hold nothing from you but ſin, which by an unfortunate
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150342:41"/>neceſſity, derived from the crime of our firſt parents, you could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſelf from communicating unto them.</p>
               <p>'Tis for this cauſe that your firſt care, after you brought them into the World, was to ſend them to the Church, to the end, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there diveſted of the Old-man wherewith they had been cloathed in your boſom, they might take a new Nativity in Chriſt Jeſus in the boſome of the Church; and that the criminal Life which you communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto them, being as it were buried and drowned in the Waters of Baptiſm, they might there receive a new life by becomming the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt Jeſus, and be enrolled in the number of the Adoptive Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the eternal Father, to come to be one day in Heaven aſſociates of the Glory of his only Son, and the coheyrs of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>'Tis not therefore enough to have ſaid, that you ought to look on them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150342:42"/>as the goods of God, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in your hands; ſince they are really his Children whom he hath committed to your care; that 'tis the price of his Blood which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to you, and that he offers to you in them many favourable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to make appear the zeal and the fidelity you have for his intereſts.</p>
               <p>What a glory is it, my Siſter, to be admitted to the ſame Miniſtery with the Angels; to be choſen to be the viſible Guardian and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Souls which Chriſt Jeſus hath redeemed with his Blood, and which he hath deſtinated (in quality of his Spouſes) to reign with him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally?</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore watch carefully for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: Fear to ſuffer profane hands to touch them: cheriſh them, nouriſh them as the Members of Chriſt Jeſus, and perſwade your ſelf that your Houſe ſhould be all Holy, ſince it encloſes thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

               <p>The conformity with Chriſt Jeſus which they have received in being re-born in the boſom of the Church, is only groſs and imperfect, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terms of the Apoſtle St. <hi>James,</hi> they become thereby but only <hi>as a beginning of the new creature: James</hi> 1.18. and therefore it is, that ſhe conſigns them to your care, to the end you may make them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Imitators of Chriſt Jeſus, that you may draw in them his Image, and that (as the Apoſtle ſays of himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19.) you may not fear to ſuffer the pains and pangs of a ſecond bringing forth Children, till ſuch time as Chriſt Jeſus is formed in their actions, their

Thus it is that by following meerly the movings of Nature, which is totally corrupted by ſin, Parents without any deſign to diſtill Vice into their Children, do notwithſtanding educate them only according to the Maxims of fleſh and blood, which are contrary to them of the Goſpel, and which draw them into an unhappy neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of following the World.</p>

               <p>When I ſay, my Siſter, that this Negligence of Fathers and Mothers draws the Children to follow the World, think not that I intend to ſpeak of the Civil Society, and that I complain only that Parents bring not up all their Children in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of making them Religious. I ſpeak of the World, which your ſelf hath made them renounce, by making them receive Baptiſm; of the World which hath been excommunicated by the mouth of Chriſt Jeſus; of the World which hath much love and much eſteem for the goods of the Earth, and for the pleaſures and commodities of Life, and which hath nothing but averſion and contempt for that which God loves, and for what he commands. <hi>John</hi> 1.15. and <hi>ch.</hi> 17.</p>

               <p>Be afraid, my Siſter, be afraid to fall into this blindeneſſe: and ſince it proceeds only from the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection which Parents make upon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150342:47"/>the excellency of their Vocation; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider often, that you have in cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that which is in the world moſt precious, that not only the whole world was created for this childe whom you are to educate, but that Chriſt Jeſus himſelf annihilated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for him. Hereupon proteſt that you will not love him, but becauſe he hath loved him; That you will take an exact care of him becauſe he belongs to him; and that you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with humility and joy all the pains you are to endure, in training him up to perfection, in regard of the pains and labours which Chriſt Jeſus ſuffered for him, and of the bloud which he powred forth to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie him.</p>

               <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> puts all theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the mouth of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Mother, whom he introduces thus exhorting her Daughters to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>You may (ſays this Holy Mother to her children) juſtifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and diſcharge your Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by making appear in your conduct thoſe graces which we have perchance neglected, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have made bad uſe. The only thing which may hinder us
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150342:48"/>from repenting our ſelves of our Marriage, is to ſee you draw ſome profit from the labours we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; and I ſhall eſteem my ſelf almoſt as happy to be a Mother of Virgins, as if I my ſelf had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Virginity. Conſider my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who ſhe was whom the Son of God coming into the World to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it, choſe for his Mother: She was a Virgin: Thus it is, my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I wiſh the purity of your life may repair the defects of mine.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt Book which this Holy Doctor made for the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Virgins, addreſſing his ſpeech to Fathers and Mothers: You have underſtood, ſays he to them, what are the Virtues which you ought to teach your Daughters to practiſe, and what Rules you are to follow in their Education: A Virgin is a gift the moſt pleaſing one we can offer to God, and the richeſt Preſent which Parents can make to his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150342:48"/>'tis a ſacred Hoſtie, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice whereof being dayly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed renders God propitious towards the Mother who preſents it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Do not therefore propoſe to your ſelf, my Siſter, any thing that is mean or indifferent in the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Children, ſince you your ſelf are ſo much intereſſed therein, and that even the cries and tears of your children in the cradle intercede for you with God and pray for you: as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> avers, writing to a Roman Dame concerning her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>You have already ſeen the ſtrict Obligation which all Chriſtians have to tend to the higheſt perfection; let therefore your principal care be to bring your children to it, and let it be your only ambition to make them great Saints.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150342:49"/>more fair, better poliſhed, and fitlier wrought and prepared, they ſhall be put in a place more eminent, and you from them ſhall derive greater glory. They are in your houſe as ſtatues of Gold, which you ought to form and embelliſh every day, if you deſire they ſhould repreſent perfectly their true Modell which is Chriſt Jeſus, and that they ſhould be his true Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. They are the Dwelling houſes and the Tabernacles choſen by God for his habitation: and therefore <q>take heed (as St. <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> adviſes) leſt by your fault the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God be turned into a retreat of Thieves, and that Chriſt Jeſus ſhould give to you the ſame reproach, which he gave to the Jews. Know (proceeds this Father) that the hearts of your children become the retreats of thieves, when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit baſe and ſervile deſires to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them, and irregular concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences to maſter them. For 'tis theſe ſorts of affections, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150342:49"/>(more cruel and more dangerous than theives) raviſh from them the liberty which grace gave them, and which after they have pierced them through on all ſides, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them with moſt dangerous wounds, reduce them into the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Paſſions and vices.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I conjure you, my Siſter, to form a reſolution without delay to proceed in ſuch ſort as that your children fall not into this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed ſervitude.

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:150342:50"/>
               <p>I ſtay not upon this, that the cares of his Providence reſpect only the intereſts of our Souls; nor upon that, that God propoſes for the end of all his works to put us in poſſeſſion of eternal happineſs: I entreat you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſerve what hath been his conduct in regard of the Jewiſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom all the Fathers, after St. <hi>Paul,</hi> look upon as in an eſtate of Infancy and Puerility in reſpect of Chriſtians, whom Grace (according to St.

                  <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>) hath rendred ripe in years.</p>
               <p>Behold the care God takes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire that people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from Idolaters, and to interdict them from all commerce with ſtrangers, leſt their Example or their Doctrine ſhould corrupt and pervert them: He gives them his Law and his Commandements: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with a holy horrour (if we may ſay ſo) of his greatneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and of his Majeſty, to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150342:51"/>and they ſhould fear to offend him. He rigorouſly chaſtiſes their leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelities and their ſinalleſt Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. And out of the care he hath to make them acknowledge that 'tis he alone who ſupplies all their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, who protects them againſt all their enemies, and who affords them all the goods they poſſeſs; he endeavours to make them enter into the feelings of love and gratitude for his bounty, and into an humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the orders of his Divine Wiſdom and Will. He inſtructs them in the moſt hidden truths, and in all the Myſteries of Chriſt Jeſus; But he inſtructs them as Children, that is, by preſenting only ſhadows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them and Figures, and by making them to practice after a groſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and accommodated to their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that which the faithfull in a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age and after the coming of Chriſt Jeſus ought to know and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>'Tis thus, my Siſter, that you are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150342:51"/>to prefer that which regards the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Intereſts of your children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that touches their temporal good. They muſt even from their tendereſt years be eſtranged from all company which may carry them on to Vice: you are to inſtil into them a great horrour of ſin, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme dread to diſpleaſe God; you are to accuſtome them to bleſs him and to thank him for all they have, making them to underſtand that 'tis he alone who gives them all things by your hands, and that he is their true Father: you ought finally accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their weak capacity make them know Chriſt Jeſus, and you are to apply your ſelf ſingularly to cauſe them to imitate his actions by inſinuating into them a love of his Maxims.</p>
               <p>Now if you being a Mother, would have me propoſe to you the example of a Mother: caſt your eyes, my Siſter, upon the Church which is ours. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin her conduct, and conform to it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150342:52"/>yours by ſo much the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe your Marriage Repreſents her Union with Chriſt Jeſus, and the Image of her alliance with him.</p>
               <p>Conſider how careful this holy Mother is to imprint in her children a ſtrong averſion from the Vanities of the World, and an ardent love for croſſes and ſufferings. They are yet ſcarcely Born, when ſhe makes them renounce all the Pomps of Satan, and engraves the Croſs upon the moſt conſiderable parts of their Bodies. And what doth ſhe teach them after this, but Chriſt Jeſus crucified? Wherewith doth ſhe entertain them but with humiliations and with his annihilations? And what doth ſhe repreſent to them in her ſolemnities, in her Ceremonies, in her Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in all that which ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to their eyes, but what he hath done to give them the marks of his infinite love? She aims at nothing more than to render them worthy of his graces and of his mercies. She
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150342:52"/>cannot endure they ſhould do the leaſt action to diſpleaſe him; and the height of her ambition is, that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould live and labour only for Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>'Tis for this cauſe that although ſhe hath for them all the tenderneſs that can be deſired, yet ſhe educates them in a ſpirit of Penance; and exerciſing them in Faſtings and other Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations diſpoſes them (according to the thought of <hi>Tertullian</hi>) to ſuffer if it is neceſſary Martyrdom it ſelf; not carrying them on to Joy, but in regard of the glory which her Bridegroom poſſeſſes, and which he hath merited for them.</p>
               <p>Behold the care ſhe takes to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them by Confirmation in the grace and the life which they have received in Baptiſm; to ſuſtain them and to nouriſh them with the Word of God, and with the Sacrament of the Altar; and finally with what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity ſhe puniſhes the leaſt of their faults in Penance: If they engage
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150342:53"/>themſelves in any Miniſtery which concern's Religion, ſhe confirms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the caracter of Holy Orders to introduce them into it, that they may worthily acquit themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: If they incline to Marriage, ſhe diſpoſes their hearts by her Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the graces which are neceſſary for them. In a word, ſhe ſuſtains them not, ſhe entertains them not, ſhe nouriſhes them not, but by Chriſt Jeſus, and of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I know, my Siſter, that all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not capable of theſe Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but I alſo know, that there are none of them who may not be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in this ſpirit.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150342:53"/>proper for the glory of Martyrdom. I know that according to the King-Prophet, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3. he eſtabliſhes his ſoveraign Power by the mouth of children, and even of them who hang yet at their Mothers breaſts to confound his Enemies; and that when he reprehends his Diſciples for hindring theſe little children to come to him, as 'tis mentioned in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. theſe very Infants whom he will have permitted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him were in the arms of their Parents, and had not ſtrength to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves.</p>
               <p>So that there's no Mother who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not and who ought not imitate the Church in this ardent deſire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating her children to Chriſt Jeſus, who may not (as doth the Church) cauſe them to ſuck with their Milk the love of her Commandements, and inſtill into them by the modeſty of their dreſs, and by the ſimplicity ſhe uſes in ſuch things as ſhe gives them, a generous contempt of all the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150342:54"/>Vanities of the World, and a great eſteem of poverty; who may not, by not educating them with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy which the love of the fleſh hath invented, prepare them as the Church doth to endure Faſting and other Exerciſes of Mortification.</p>
               <p>And ſince the Mothers teach chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſpeak, and make them know the things which are neceſſary for them, they may without doubt as the Church doth, teach them as ſoon the Name of Jeſus as that of their Father;

               <p>'TIs not enough for the making a perfect Copy that a Painter hath before him an Original: he muſt moreover know perfectly the Rules of Painture, and reduce into Practiſe in making this Copy all the Maxims of his Art. It ſuffices not then that you propoſe to your ſelf in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your children theſe excei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Idea's which I have repreſented unto you, and which you are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to imitate: You muſt further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more know all the Maxims you are to follow to come to the perfection of theſe Divine Originals; and you ought to know the Rules which the Spirit of God hath preſcribed you, not only in the ſacred Scriptures, but particularly in the writings of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150342:55"/>the Fathers of the Church, who are its holy Interpreters.</p>
               <p>For experience alone cannot teach Fathers and Mothers the Education of their Children. It oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that they themſelves remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not in what manner they were educated, and that they were too young to obſerve it in their Brothers and Siſters who followed them.</p>
               <p>Wherfore that you may yet clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier underſtand the need you have of theſe Maxims, and to diſcover unto you by the way upon what grounds they are eſtabliſhed by the Fathers of the Church, I entreat you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that although Children are ſanctified in Baptiſm, and that they are there repleniſhed with the graces and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; yet the concupiſcence is not taken from them in this Sacrament, and there remains in their hearts a certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination towards the creature, which is the cauſe of all the ſins committed in the World, and which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150342:55"/>attributed to the corruption of Nature.</p>
               <q>'Tis this concupiſcence which (in the opinion of St.
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 1. <hi>Conf.</hi> c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>) cauſes children to covet the duggs of their Mothers with ſo much greedineſs, and to ſeek for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of their Nurſe with ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſigns of impatience. 'Tis through it that they demand with ſo much eagerneſs and tears the things which are hurtful unto them: that they are vexed and diſpleaſed with them who will not ſubmit to them, that they ſhew themſelves froward againſt free perſons, and ſuch whoſe age ſhould render ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable to them, againſt their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, and againſt ſo many others who are incomparably wiſer then themſelves; and that they ſtrive even as much as they can to hurt them by ſtriking them, becauſe they will not do what they deſire of them, nor will blindly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150342:56"/>them in things which would prove pernicious unto them. And thus (purſues this Father) the weakneſs of the Body is innocent in Children, but the ſpirit of Children is not ſo; and we ſuffer in them patiently many things not becauſe they are not bad, ſince one cannot ſuffer them in perſons more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in age, but becauſe we hope they will vaniſh together with their Infancy.</q>
               <p>You are therefore, my Siſter, to conſider your children as totally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and wholly bent to evil. And do not doubt, but theſe impatiences which they make appear, this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation not to will but what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will, this deſpight, this love of play, this diſguſt of their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, this curioſity, this deſire of overcoming, this ardour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, this averſion they have from Prayer, this jealouſy they conceive upon the ſigns of friendſhip given to their Brothers or Siſters, this envy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150342:56"/>and this deſire to ravin from others all they poſſeſs; finally, the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have to lye, and the eſteem they have for the glittering vanities and ornaments of the World, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſame principle which cauſes the hatreds, the murthers, the envies, the jealouſies, the deſire and the love of the goods of the earth, and of the Pomps of the World, and which cauſes them to fall, who are in a ripe and advanced age, into greater diſorder.</p>
               <p>In effect, grace being not given to man, but to perfect his Nature, the action of grace ſuppoſes that of nature; and man muſt be capable to reaſon before he can be aſſiſted and ſuſtained in his ratiocination. So that the ſuperiour part of the ſoul being not capable in children to do its functions; and the regulation of the inferiour depending on its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and its lights: this which hath no need of extraordinary ſuccours to carry it on towards its object,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150342:57"/>but which hath a natural bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pleaſing things, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be regulated by grace, which doth not yet act in them; ſeizes upon the command, and gives liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all the paſſions to ſally forth, and to make appear in all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of children, and in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motions, the Empire they have in their hearts, and the violence wherewith they draw them towards creatures.</p>

There is none for them, Lord, there is none for them, my God; and I demand your pardon yet at this day, for having been of the number of theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. For 'tis the very ſame and this firſt corruption of their ſpirit and of their heart, which paſſes by ſequel into all the reſt of their life. Such as they were in reſpect of their preceptours, and of their Maſters,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150342:57"/>they are in regard of Kings and of Magiſtrates. After they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted petty-Injuſtices to get Nuts, Balls, and Birds; they commit great ones to heap up Money, to get fair Houſes, and to have a multitude of Servants. Their irregularity encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with their age, as the great Puniſhments which the laws ordain, ſucceed the light Puniſhments of children. And thus, my God and my King, when you ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven is for them who are like to children,</hi> you did not only propoſe the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their Spirit for a modell of Virtue, but alſo the littleneſs of their Bodies as the image of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</q>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150342:60"/>addreſſing himſelf to Fathers, ſpeaks to them in this ſort: Liſten to this you Fathers, and bring up your Children with great care in the Diſcipline and in the Correction of our Lord. Suffer them not ever to do ſuch actions, which as pleaſant as they are, ceaſe not to be malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and do not pardon them in any fault upon pretext of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Keep them above all in a great reſtraint and in a great ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Advertiſe them, correct them, affright them, threaten them, and if need requires, make them feel the effects of your threats.</p>
                     <p>You have in your Children a conſiderable and very precious pledge, keep it with great care, and do all things to hinder the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing of it away from you. Be not ſo void of reaſon as to take a greater care of your goods and pof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, than of them for whom you heap up all thoſe things. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Spirits whilſt they are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150342:61"/>yet tender, to Virtue and to Piety, and then you may think of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for them the other comodities of life. Will you leave your Son rich, ſee that he be Virtuous, and that he be Charitable: for that's the means whereby he will encreaſe his Patrimony, or at leaſt 'tis that which will render him as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his pittance as if he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all the Earth. But if he is vicious, great riches will only ſerve to furniſh him wherewith to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his bad cuſtoms, and to cauſe him to abandon himſelf without controll to all ſorts of debauchery.</p>
                     <p>Mothers, it belongs to you to take care of the Daughters you have; and this is not hard for you to do. Order it ſo, that they keep conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at home. Inſtruct them prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in piety and devotion, teach them a contempt of riches and of all worldly Pomps and Vanities. And ſince if you thus educate them, they will not only ſave their own
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150342:61"/>Souls, but moreover them of their Husbands and of their Children; perform all that concerns them with a ſerious application, as labouring in one ſole perſon for the glory and for the Salvation of many others. For a Daughter ſhould go forth of the houſe of her Parents, to enter into that of her Husband, perfectly inſtructed in every thing that is neceſſary for the good government of a Family; and ſhe ought to be ſo perfect, that like as a little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven communicates its qualities to all the paſte, ſo ſhe ſhould cauſe her Virtues to paſs into all them whom ſhe is to conduct and govern.</p>
                     <p>Let the manners of your male-children be ſo honeſt, and their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo ſingular, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve prayſe from God and from Men. Let them learn under your Diſcipline, Abſtinence, and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not to make ſuperfluous expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but to let alone all magnificence, which is commonly ſought after in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150342:62"/>things of ſhew and luſtre, to employ their goods lawfully; to be ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to you, and to be obedient to the leaſt of your Words.</p>

Let us prefer before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſollicitudes that of correcting and inſtructing our children in the fear of our Lord. If your ſon learns from his tender Infancy to live Chriſtianly, he will acquire goods much more conſiderable, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far greater, than the World can procure him. You will not gain ſo much by inſtructing him how to heap up exteriour riches, as in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him how to contemn them: do ſo then if you deſire to make him rich; ſince he is truly ſo, who needs nothing.</p>
                     <p>Do not ſtrive to ſettle him in a condition wherein he may acquire
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150342:62"/>great glory by his learning; but teach him to put a ſmall value upon all worldly glory. Seek not out means to make him live long upon earth, but ſuch means as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to procure for him an eternal life in heaven. Think not of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo much an able man, as of rendring him a faithful man. He ſtands in need of Modeſty, and not of Eloquence; of good manners, and not of crafts and ſubtilties; of good actions, and not of fine words; endeavour to render his ſoul pure, rather than his tongue poliſhed: Not that I forbid the inſtruction of children, but 'tis this I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that one ſhould only ſtrive to teach them human Literature, and neglect to inform them what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Let us put our children by our prudent conduct into an eſtate to endure patiently all ſorts of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and not to become inſolent in proſperity. If they who make

Fortify then your heart againſt their moans and tears, and

And you are to take ſo much more care and heed of this irregular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by how much we ſee in the ſacred Scripture that it hath been the origin of the greateſt crimes and of the greateſt irregularities of men.

                  <p>Love then your Children, but with a love which is holy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from the ſenſes; a love which ſtays not on the outſide, and on that which pleaſes the World, as upon beauty, a good grace, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile garb, a pleaſing humour, and a quick vivacity in converſation, and in reparties or returning nimble jeſts and replies.</p>
                  <p>Love them with a love that is ſtrong and full of ſweetneſs; a love which patiently ſuffers their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and their infirmities, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptneſs to do the good things you tell them, their lightneſſes and even their little diſobediences, without ever altering or cooling it; but on the contrary redoubling its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour towards them whoſe infirmities of body or Spirit are the greateſt.

                  <p>Take heed above all, that they get not a hatred of Studies, leſt they having taken an averſion from them in their tender age, ſhould retain it in their riper years. Endeavour to make them love what they muſt be conſtrained one day to learn and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; to the end it may not be then a pain to them but a pleaſure, and that they may not do it by conſtraint, but by their own choice. You muſt neglect none of theſe leaſt things, when the greateſt cannot well ſubſiſt without them.</p>
                  <p>Encreaſe and nouriſh in them the love of labour, by keeping them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employed. Let the changing of their buſineſs be their divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and let pious reading ſucceed their prayers and employs. Time ſeems ſhort when it is divertiſed by good occupations.</p>
                  <p>Remember that there's no time to be loſt in the inſtruction of children;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150342:69"/>and that as you are to apply your ſelf to form their manners from their moſt tender years, you are alſo from their moſt tender Infancy to imprint in them the firſt diſpoſition to the Sciences.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that one can hardly during all that time teach them what they will apprehend in one ſole year of their riper age. But becauſe they muſt of neceſſity be employed in ſomething, even in that age, one can aſſuredly do nothing better to make them employ their time profitably, after they once begin to ſpeak, than in making them to ſtudy to ſpeak natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in good terms: and one ſhould never neglect any thing which may conduce in the leaſt to their advantage, becauſe they will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become capable to learn things of more importance in the age in which they muſt learn thoſe of leſs concern, if they have not already learned them. 'Tis thus that advancing by little and little, children finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150342:69"/>capable in their youth of great matters; and that the time well husbanded during their Infancy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes much to make them employ more profitably the time of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing youth.</p>
                  <p>Yet they muſt not be too much preſſed to any thing, but one is to accommodate ones ſelf to their ſtrength and to the reach of their ſpirit. Studies have (as it were) their Infancy as well as man: and as the ſtrongeſt bodies have been nouriſhed with milk, and laid in a cradle in the firſt years of their life, ſo the moſt eloquent Men have ſent forth cries like others, and have had at their beginning like them a difficulty to ſpeak and to form their Letters.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150342:74"/>and Mothers excite not their children to virtue, to ſtudie, and to other laudable exerciſes, but only by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and temporal conſiderations, and which are all founded upon am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and upon intereſt. See how this great Saint expreſſes the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of one of thoſe Fathers tyed to the World, by making him ſpeak in theſe terms to one of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: <q>Behold my Son, behold this man; he was very meanly born, and had many other inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities: and yet becauſe he was eloquent, he paſſed through the greateſt Offices and employs; he hath heaped up vaſt riches, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a wealthy wife, built proud Pallaces; finally, he hath made himſelf dreaded and reſpected by all the World. This other, O my Son, (proceeds this worldly Father,) got not the reputation he hath at Court, but becauſe he was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly skilled in the Latine Tongue. And thus it is, (exclaims this great
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150342:75"/>Doctour,) that we enchant the ears of your children to introduce into their hearts the two moſt violent paſſions which are in the world, to wit, the deſire of riches and that of vain-glory, which corrupt and ſtifle in their ſouls all the ſeeds of virtue; which cauſe to ſpring up there ſuch a quantity of thorns and bryars, and which ſpread about ſo much ſand and duſt, that their ſpirit remains barren and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to produce any fruit,</q>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:150342:79"/>age and in judgement: and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that there's nothing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than to accuſtome children to chaſtiſement, becauſe thereby one hardens them rather then corrects them.</p>
                  <p>It were to be wiſhed that children had never heard the mention of blows or of rods; that the ſole deſire to pleaſe you, or the ſole dread to anger you, regulated all their motions; and that, following the Counſel of a great Biſhop, you could bring them to reſpect you rather by your ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and by your goodneſs, than by a harſh and ſevere carriage.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I conceive that the rigour which the ſacred Scripture, in thoſe many paſſages which I have before-cited, ordains to follow in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of children, is exerciſed much more perfectly, and even according to the ſpirit of God, by the refuſal of a kiſs or of ordinary cheriſhings, than by whippings or other bad treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body; and that the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150342:79"/>greateſt dexterity of Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſiſts in rendring their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo jealous of the marks of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they give them, whereby they become much afflicted at the leaſt coldneſs appearing in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; that they fear nothing more than to be deprived of their preſence; and that nothing is to them more ſenſible, than to ſee their Father or their Mother prefer the ſervice even of an underling upon occaſions when they were diſpoſed themſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them.</p>

                  <p>Children ought in many occaſions to ſubmit their lights to them of their Parents, and to prefer their judgement before their own: but 'tis alſo the duty of Parents to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to their children thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lights to which they pretend they ought to ſubject themſelves.

                  <p>We have a proof convincing this truth in a dreadful hiſtory related by St.

                     <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in ſeveral of his works, and which cannot be too often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, amidſt the diſpleaſures they receive from their Children.</p>
                  <p>There was in the Town of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> a widow of quality who had ten children, to wit, ſeven ſons and three Daughters: the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of all theſe children, ſo far loſt the reſpect he ought to his Mother, that after he had loaded her with many injurious words, he was ſo raſh as to ſtrike her. His Brothers and his Siſters were witneſſes of this outrage, not only without oppoſing themſelves, but even without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſole word in defence of their Mother. This poor Woman having her heart pearced with ſorrow for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:150342:84"/>ſo great an injury, and ſuffering her ſelf to proceed in the reſentment of the affront ſhe had received, took a reſolution to lay her curſe upon her wretched ſon who had ſo highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon ſhe goes forth of her at day-break to pronounce this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation againſt him upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Font of Baptiſm. The Devil preſented himſelf to her in her way under the form of her husbands brother who was Uncle to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and queſtions her whether ſhe was now going? ſhe anſwered, that ſhe went to lay a curſe upon her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son becauſe of the inſupportable injury he had done to her: then that accurſed fiend who had no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to finde an entrance into the heart of this Mother, which the ſpirit of revenge and of anger had opened unto him, perſwades her to extend her malediction upon all her other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſince their ſilence rendred them no leſs criminalls than their eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:150342:84"/>
                  <p>This Woman therefore ſuffering her ſelf to be enflamed with choler againſt all her children by that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed counſells of this tempter, comes to clip and embrace the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Font, ſpreads abroad her hair, diſcovers her breaſt, and demands of God in this poſture, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her of all her children in ſuch a manner as that they may bear about them over all the earth, the marks of the chaſtiſement laid upon them for the outrage ſhe received from them; and that they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print by their example a terrour into the ſpirits of all people.</p>
                  <p>Her prayer was heard ſo ſpeedily, that her eldeſt ſon was ſtruck at the ſame inſtant with a horrible trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in all the Members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and within leſs then one year all her other children were puniſhed with the ſame chaſtiſement, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, according to the order of their birth.</p>
                  <p>Then this unfortunate Mother,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150342:85"/>perceiving her curſes to have been ſo efficacious, and being no longer able to ſupport the reproaches which her conſcience ſuggeſted to her of her impiety, nor the confuſion which ſhe ſuffered before the world for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting her ſelf to be tranſported to ſo great an extremity, ſtrangled her ſelf, and ended her accurſed life by a death yet more accurſed.</p>

                     <q>Let children learn from this example to reſpect their Fathers and their Mothers, and let Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fear to fall into choler againſt their children. 'Tis ſaid in ſacred Writ, <hi>That the bleſſing of a Father
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:150342:85"/>eſtabliſhes the Houſe, and that the curſe of a Mother roots it up even to the foundations.</hi> This we ſee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in theſe accurſed children, who being at this preſent vagabonds over all the earth, have no eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their own countrey, and who not only ſerve for a dreadful ſpectacle to all men, but alſo by preſenting their puniſhment and their miſery to the eyes of all them who look upon them, ſhould above all affright proud children, who fail in their duty towards them who brought them into the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>Learn then, O children, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto your Fathers and Mothers according to what is commanded you in the ſacred Scripture, the reſpect and the honour which is due to them. But you, Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, remember, when your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren offend you, that you are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that you are Mothers: This unhappy Mother invoked God againſt her children, and ſhe was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150342:86"/>heard becauſe God is truly juſt, and becauſe ſhe had been truly offended. True it is, that there was but one only among them who had injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtruck her, and the other had only been ſilent in this occaſion, or had not uttered a word in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But ſurely God is juſt who heard her prayer, and who gave ear to the expreſſions which grief put into her mouth. All this while what ſhall we ſay of this poor Mother? Was not ſhe her ſelf puniſhed by God with ſo much more rigour, by how much ſhe was heard more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more conformably to her own deſires?</q>
                  <p>'Tis thus, my Siſter, that this great Saint believed that God permitted this Mother ſhould make ſo unhappy an end, after ſhe had abandoned her ſelf to ſuch choler againſt her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to teach Fathers and Mothers not to ſuffer themſelves to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported eaſily to ſuch reſentments, although moſt juſt in appearance;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:150342:86"/>and not eaſily to lay their maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their children, however ſo reaſonable a cauſe they may ſeem to have for ſo doing; and never to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the ſuccour of God againſt them during the violence of their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for fear leſt God hearing the prayers which grief drew from their hearts, and granting to them the things which paſſion alone inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to demand of him, the revenge which they call down upon their childrens heads falls not upon their own, and hurry them not on to deſpair, when the heat being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over, and the feeling of nature having got the upper hand, they ſhall perceive themſelves to have been the cauſe of the miſery and ruine into which their wretched children are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                  <p>And this reflexion ought to make ſo much the deeper impreſſion in the ſpirit of Fathers and Mothers, becauſe this miſerable Mother we have here ſpoken of, was in deſperate hazzard
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:150342:87"/>of being damned for all eternity for having ſuffered her ſelf to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to that exceſs of revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her children: whereas the ſaid children were not puniſhed for the fault they committed againſt her, but only during this life; and that God afforded mercy to the major part of them, at the inſtant prayers, and importunities of holy men, to whom they had recourſe in their affliction; as was ſeen in two of them who were recovered; in one at <hi>Hippo,</hi> and in another of them at <hi>Revenna.</hi>

                  <p>IF God gives you many children, take care to unite them in perfect friendſhip with one another; let the younger reſpect the elder; let the elder condeſcend to the younger as being yet leſs rational: and make in every thing appear ſo juſt an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150342:87"/>in the marks of love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them, that they may have no manner of jealouſie againſt one another. The only embroidered robe which <hi>Jacob</hi> gave to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was cauſe of the hatred his Brethren conceived againſt him, and that they hatched the deſign to take away his life.</p>
                  <p>Upon which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> makes this pithy reflexion: <q>It very frequently falls out, that the affection of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is hurtful to their children when it ſtays not within the limits of a juſt moderation: and this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, when either through an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great goodneſs they pardon their faults, or that teſtifying more love to ſome than to others, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh by this preference that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection which ſhould keep them united in friendſhip. The greateſt advantage which a Father can procure to one of his children, is to leave him the love of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, As Fathers and Mothers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:150342:88"/>exerciſe a more glorious libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity towards their children; ſo alſo the children cannot receive from their Fathers and Mothers a more rich Inheritance than that. It is juſt that nature rendring them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, the favour of them who gave them birth ſhould continue them in a perfect equality. Piety permits us not to fancy, that Money gives an advantage to a childe, ſince it is that very thing which ruins piety. Why then do you ſtill marvel that ſo many differences ariſe among Brethren upon the occaſion of a piece of land, or of a houſe, ſince one ſole garment excited ſo much envy among the children of <hi>Jacob?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <q>But what, (adds this holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,) ſhall we blame this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triark for preferring one of his ſons before all the reſt? Can we take from Fathers and from Mothers the liberty of loving them more whom they believe deſerve better their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? and is it juſt to take from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:150342:88"/>Children the emulation and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of pleaſing them more who gave them their birth? Finally, <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Joſeph</hi> more than all his brethren, becauſe he foreſaw that this childe would be one day more virtuous than the others, and becauſe he diſcovered already in him more viſible and more illuſtrious marks of goodneſs.</q>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> contain very important inſtructions for Fathers and Mothers. For although they are obliged to have an equal charity for all their children, it is notwithſtanding a very hard matter not to reſent ſometimes in themſelves more tenderneſs for one than for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and there are even ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions wherein they are obliged to make it more appear.</p>
                  <p>All the difficulty then conſiſts in knowing how to regulate and to diſtribute the teſtimonies which they give them according to the rules of Chriſtian charity, and according to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:150342:89"/>the lights of Faith. It conſiſts in not preferring them who are of a more flattering and facetious humour, but alſo more free and inclinable to evil, before them who make ſhew of more coldneſs, but withall of more reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs and more modeſtie; not to cheriſh them more whom we deſign for the world then them whom we will conſecrate to Religion; to avoid the diſorder which a holy man of <hi>France</hi> hath reprehended with ſo much zeal in a Letter he addreſſes to all the Church; where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches Fathers and Mothers of high injuſtice for making greater advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſuch of their children as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the world, than of them who made profeſſion of a holy and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>What is more juſt and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable (ſays he), than that he will of parents ſhould agree with that of Chriſt Jeſus; that they ſhould prefer in the diſtribution of their goods and of their charges
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:150342:89"/>them whom God hath preferred by the choice he hath made of them to link them to his ſervice? Happy he who loves his children by the motive of divine love; who regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the charity he bears them, by that which he owes to Chriſt Jeſus; who in the bonds of nature which tye him to his children, looks upon God as their Father; who making ſacrifices to God of that which his love obliges him to give to his children, draws for himſelf an eternal gain and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and who lending to God (as we may ſay) that which he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to his children, procures for himſelf an everlaſting recompence by procuring for them temporal commodities.</p>
                     <p>But now, (adds he) Fathers and Mothers follow Maxims far different from theſe, and much deviating from the piety which here appears. They never leave leſs of their goods than to ſuch of their children to whom they ſhould leave the greater
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150342:90"/>ſhare in regard of him to whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they are engaged: and they of their family whom they leaſt eſteem, are they whom the ſpirit of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould render moſt conſiderable. Finally, if they offer to God ſome one of their children, they prefer their other Brethren before them. They judge them unworthy to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in their worldly means who are found worthy to be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Altar. And one may ſay, that their children did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come contemptible unto them, but becauſe they began to be precious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>

                  <p>This diſorder is but too common in the age we now live in, in which Parents content not themſelves to deſign to the Church or to Religion ſuch of their children who are mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt qualified, but they moreover e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neglect their education, and uſe all means imaginable to deprive them of their ſucceſſion. They ſtrive by all manner of ways to have ſome Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150342:90"/>fall into their hands, and when they have once obtained it they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the goods of the Church and the patrimony of Chriſt Jeſus inſtead of that which was due to them by their birth. They make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the juſt pretenſions they have by the natural and civil Laws: becauſe they render them depoſitaries of ſuch goods as were deſigned by the piety of the faithful for the ſubſiſtance of the poor: and they bereave them of what lawfully belonged unto them upon pretext of having procured for them that which they cannot accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons and Rules of the Church apply even to their own uſes: becauſe it is not obtained by the ways preſcribed by the ſaid Canons and the ſame Rules of the Church. <q>As if, (ſays <hi>Salvian</hi>) Parents ſhould not rather tye themſelves to leave goods to ſuch of their children as they know are capable to make the beſt uſe of them; and as if they ought not to prefer them who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150342:91"/>their means only in works of a charity, before them who will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly diſſipate them in their vain and ſuperfluous expences.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another diſorder crept in among the faithful, and which no leſs deſtroys the equality which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents owe to their children, which is, to think of ſetling them only, who either by the rank of their birth or for ſome particular qualities, beſt pleaſe them. They fear leſt by part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their goods equally among all their children, they cannot raiſe up as they would the ſplendour and the glory of their Family. The Eldeſt could not poſſeſs nor ſuſtain the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and the employs which they ſtrive to procure for him, if his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and his Siſters ſhould have the ſame advantages which he hath: they muſt therefore be put into ſuch an eſtate as not to be able to diſpute this right with him. They muſt be thruſt into Cloyſters whether they will or not, and they muſt be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150342:91"/>ſacrificed to the intereſts of him whom they deſigne for the world and for vanity.</p>
                  <p>You cannot, my Siſter, take too much care to avoid all theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are contrary to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and to the Juſtice you owe to your children. Endeavour therefore to keep among them a perfect equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But if you have ſome mark of tenderneſs and of preference to give to any one of them, let it be to the moſt obedient, and to them who tend with moſt ardour to goodneſs and to virtue; to the end that that may excite an emulation in the others, and that they encreaſing all equally in the fear of God and in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of virtue, may deſerve all the like teſtimonies of goodneſs and of affection.</p>

                  <p>It would be a great good ſo to order it, that their very recreations might contribute to exerciſe their Judgement and their memory; that according to the counſel of all the Fathers of the Church, they were

                  <p>'Tis thus that this great Doctour counſells a Roman Dame, to cauſe letters to be made of Box or of Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, thereby to teach her Daughter by playing with them, and mixing them together, to know the Letters, and to joyn them, and ſo to form Syllables: And 'tis thus, that after children can reade, one may as it were for a divertiſement ſhew them the Map, and as they grow in age and underſtanding give them a taſte of the pithieſt paſſages of the ſacred and profane Hiſtory, and oblige them to repeat the ſame, and to remember the ſacred Genealogies and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Monarks; <q>to the end, (ſays this Father,) that by ſuch very things which will be perhaps

                  </p>
                  <p>It would be alſo much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make them play ſometimes before you, and to let them recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves in your preſence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inclinations of children are more eaſily diſcovered in their Play.

He was very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to forbid all entrance to any but to them: and would to God he had uſed the ſame caution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them alſo: for I now ſee the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:150342:95"/>danger there is, when one is in an age proper to receive the firſt ſeeds of virtues, to have commerce with perſons, who knowing the vanity of the world, entice others to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves therein. I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the ſame age with my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins; we kept always together; they tenderly loved me, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them with what ever I fancied would pleaſe them. They related to me the ſucceſs of their affections, and ſuch trifles which were not very good to be heard. And which was yet worſe, my ſoul was ſenſible of impreſſions which have been the cauſe of all her evil. Ha! were I to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to Parents, I would warn them to be well adviſed what perſons frequent their children in that age; becauſe the bent of our corrupted nature bears us rather to bad than to good: I found this in my ſelf: for I made no profit of the great virtue and honeſty of one of my Siſters,

'Tis principally du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of youth that this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is moſt dangerous, and this makes me wiſh, that Fathers and Mothers would make their profit by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of my faults, to hinder by their care the like accidents: For tis but too true, that the familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I had with that perſon did ſo change me, as that it left in my ſoul no ſign of the good nature nor of the virtues which were there before: and it ſeems to me, that ſhe and one other who lived

                  <p>You ſee, my Siſter, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and by the Words of this holy woman, how reſerved you ought to be in giving acceſs to perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your childrens familiarity, although their alliance and nearneſs of blood permits you not to exclude them from your houſe; and how you muſt never ſuffer that under this pretext of parentage your children ſhould contract a ſtrict friendſhip with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who are not brought up in the fear of God, which you ſtrive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire into yours.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:150342:100"/>they were animated, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held how Chriſtian women were loaden with chains of gold, with Jewels, and with precious ſtones; and that inſteed of eſteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves glorious to be cloathed with Chriſt Jeſus, they had no paſſion but for ſtuffs of ignominy, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the language of the Church,) and for cloathes more ſuitable to courtiſans then to the Daughters of Chriſt Jeſus, that is, to Children conceived in the tears and in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a God crucified.</p>

                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> in like manner 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. recommends unto them, <hi>to be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as honeſty demands, to adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with civility, modeſty and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not with frizled Perruks, nor with trimmings of gold, nor with Pearls, nor with ſumptuous habits: but as ſuch women ought to be, who make profeſſion of piety, and who teſtify the ſame by their good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Take good heed, (ſayd formerly St. <hi>Jerome</hi>) writing to a Lady of quality concerning the Education of her Daughter, that you bore not her ears for the hanging there of Jewels, and that you paint not with white and red the Face which hath been conſecrated to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, nor give unto her Neck-laces of Pearls, nor load her head with precious ſtones: Cauſe her by the eare you take to poſſeſs the inward ornaments and the precious riches of the ſoul, wherewith ſhe may
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:150342:101"/>purchaſe the ineſtimable treaſure of Salvation.</q>
                  <p>From whence then (imagin you, my Siſter) ſprings this general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and this common obſtinacy of them of your Sex in a matter which is oppoſite to Chriſtianiſm, but from hence that this contagion is communicated to Children by the means of their Mothers, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to daughters, who (as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience makes it appear) are very ſuſceptible of their Mothers manners and inclinations.</p>
                  <p>We complain that in this age, the girls of ten years old have more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and vanity, than others had heretofore at thirty: We cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that they ſhould ſeek to be ſeen and to be courted: We wonder at the eagerneſs they have for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Comedies, Balls, and walkings abroad: but it were a matter much more to be marvelled at, if they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received from their Fathers and from their Mothers all the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150342:102"/>which are neceſſary to love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but divertiſements, and to ſeek after the occaſions of vanities and of pleaſures, as they permit them to do, they ſhould affect retiredneſs, and ſhould refuſe to pleaſe the eyes of men.</p>
                  <p>Reflect ſeriouſly upon theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant verities; and believe me, my Siſter, that there is nothing one ought not to do in order to inſtill into girls the hatred of the vanity and of the pomp of apparel: Wherefore in ſuch things as are even neceſſary to form their body, order it ſo, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes which you give them may not carry them on inſenſibly to love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and furniſh them with other motives than ſuch as the love of the world may inſpire into them.</p>
                  <p>Thus when you oblige your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to keep themſelves ſtraight, tell them, that one ought to take care to conſerve their ſtature, becauſe God hath given it to us, and that he would we ſhould always have our
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150342:102"/>eyes elevated towards him, to bleſs him, and to implore his aſiſtance; becauſe 'tis for them who have no other love but for the things of this world to crouch their body towards the earth; and becauſe finally Chriſt Jeſus hath not broken the bonds wherewith we were ſhackled, but to the end we ſhould march with our head lifted up towards Heaven. And do not tell them, that they will not be eſteemed in the world if they have not a good grace, and that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their aſſemblies, make ſmall account of the beauty of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when the ſtature of the body is crooked.</p>
                  <p>If you cloath them decently accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your condition, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of the Goſpel, make them underſtand that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour decency ought to be the mark of the inward purity and cleanneſs of their heart, and that they are to take greater care of the Ornament of their ſoul then the dreſſing of their body.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:150342:103"/>
                  <p>If,
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> to <hi>Leta.</hi>
                     </note> according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> you permit them not to affect a certain wantonneſs in the pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their words, or that they uſe words which are unproper and out of date, do not tell them, that otherwiſe they will be uncapable to receive a complement, or to entertain a company; but tell them, that by avoiding theſe defects they ought to put themſelves in condition to make others one day to know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of God, and to excite them to virtue.</p>
                  <p>Let them know, that the care you take to make them learn to work whether it be in Tapiſtry, or in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broderie, or in Points and Laces, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not out of a deſire you have that they ſhould deck themſelves with their own works; but out of the knowledge you have of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to make good uſe of their time, and of the eaſineſs they may have by this means to help their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:150342:103"/>neighbour by their labours.</p>
                  <p>Finally, inſtruct them to want e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven things permitted and which are innocent; to the end they may have no love for thoſe things which are forbidden. St. <hi>Lewis</hi> who was one of the chiefeſt Saints and greateſt Princes of the world, never ſuffered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes his Daughters to wear upon Fridays, Garlands and Coronets of Roſes and of other Flowers, which were the richeſt ornaments of their age; becauſe Chriſt Jeſus had been crowned with thorns upon that day.</p>
                  <p>This great King was far from that accurſed complacency of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who being interiourly attracted to recollection and to a contempt of worldly vanities, engage themſelves nevertheleſs in dangerous converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aſſemblies upon pretext of their having children, that it is fit they ſhould divertiſe themſelves, and that they muſt yield ſomething (ſay they) to an age which is totally
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:150342:104"/>addicted to pleaſure. As if theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderations ought not to oblige them to break off the intelligence they might have with the world, and as if the fear of engaging their children in dangerous companies, out of which they ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance eſcape with ſo much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as themſelves have done, were not ſufficient to make them ſhun theſe encounters, and to move them to chooſe a life which is more Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, more modeſt, and more retired than the former.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay, my Siſter, becauſe there are many Fathers and Mothers who fancy they can juſtify themſelves one day before God for having quitted their ſolitude to lead their children to a Ball; for having ſtifled the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings they had of a ſimplicity in their garments to ſatisfy the vanity and the ambition of their children; for not having openly embraced all the other Maxims and all the other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Goſpel, for fear of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:150342:104"/>their children to follow them, and for cauſing them to enter into a diſguſt of the Maxims and vanities of the World. As if this unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the motions of a grace, which was perchance given them for the ſanctification of their children, ought not to make them apprehend the juſt judgments of God; and that they were not to anſwer to him for all the bad thoughts, for all the evil deſires, and for all the libertine actions done by their children in theſe aſſemblies, and which indeed they perceived not, but which the eyes of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and which his juſtice will impute one day to the compliance of them who engaged them in theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Take good heed alſo of imitating thoſe Mothers, who upon pretext of ſparing, or becauſe they are tired with the vanities and with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the world, uncloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to cloath their children; and who by a kinde of hypocriſie, the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150342:105"/>moſt dangerous that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not daring to follow the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the world it felf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits only to youth, will at leaſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy their vanity by making their daughters follow thoſe modes, and who being themſelves no longer fit for pleaſures and divertiſements, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (as ſays St. <hi>Jerome</hi>) <q>thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Souls the moſt ordinary ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of pleaſure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not inſiſt here to repreſent to you the obligation you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſuffer your Daughters to paint and patch themſelves; to ruddy their lips and to blacken their eye brows; to whiten their cheeks, and to ſeek out ſuch other ridiculous vanities; which the ſpirit of the world hath invented upon pretext of repairing the defects of nature, but in effect to ſatisfy the paſſion which they of their Sex have to pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>That which I have now ſpoken of the exceſſes and magnificent cloathes, ſuffices to make you comprehend
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150342:105"/>how far you ought to eſtrange them from thoſe follies; ſince there is leſs evil, according to the Fathers, in theſe proud Garments, than in trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the face with ſtrange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> among the Latin Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the books he made for the Inſtruction of Virgins, highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in Chriſtian Women, curl'd hayr, Necklaces of Pearls, Pendants at the Ears, and other ſuch like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. But there's nothing which he beats down with more zeal and with greater eloquence,

                     </note> than the care which the women of his time took to paint themſelves upon the pretext of pleaſing their husbands. He plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly rails at them for thus betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by ſeeking in this manner ſtrange beauties; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches them, in that by applying themſelves with ſo much ſtudie to change the lineaments of their face, they condemn themſelves, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> among the Greek Fathers, teaching husbands (who have wives which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together worldlings,
<note place="margin">S <hi>Chriſtoſt. ſer.</hi> 10. in <hi>Matth.</hi>
                     </note> who love exceſſive riots, and are plunged in delights) after what manner they are to labour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from theſe irregularities; counſels them not to begin by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving them of their magnificent dreſſings, but by taking away the ſolicitude they have of painting their faces. And this holy Doctour produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nothing upon this ſubject, which a Mother ought not to make uſe of, if ſhe perceives any of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to have the leaſt inclination to theſe ſort of vanities. For then it is that ſhe ſhould repreſent unto her, <q>that there is no wiſe man who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns not them that diſguiſe thus the viſage by pouders and by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed colours, to force in ſome ſort nature, and to give to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:150342:106"/>what they have not; and who having been bred in the Faith and in the knowledge of the true God, and having Chriſt Jeſus for their head, they ought not to ſeek an artificial beauty by theſe diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which the Devil hath invented.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Conſider, (ſays in the ſequel the ſaid Doctour addreſſing his ſpeech to all Chriſtian Women,) that Chriſt Jeſus is your Bridegroom; that 'tis for him you ought to adorn your ſelves; and then you will avoid with horrour theſe ſhameful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments. For Chriſt Jeſus loves not theſe falſe and counterfeit dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. His will is, that his ſpouſes ſhould be fair, but with a true beauty. 'Tis that beauty which the Prophet adviſes you to keep with care, when he tells you, <hi>and the King will love your beauty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us then no longer ſeek thoſe ſtudied beauties, which are as ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are vain: The works of God are compleat: He hath put
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:150342:107"/>there all that there ſhould be, and he hath no need of you to reform them. After an excellent Painter hath finiſhed the Kings Picture, no one dares preſume to adde ſtrange colours; and ſuch a boldneſs would not paſs unpuniſhed. You have then a reſpect for the work of a man; and dare you alter and corrupt the work of God? you do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that there is a Hell: you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not at the conſideration of thoſe flames; you forget your very ſoul, and you treat her unworthily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any care of her, becauſe you give all your thoughts and all your affections to your Body.</p>
                     <p>But I miſtake when I talk to you of your ſoul, ſince you give to your body no better treatment, and that there comes to it the contrary of what you pretend: you will appear fair by this Paint, and it ſerves only to make you deformed: you will pleaſe your husband, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more diſpleaſes him, and not
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150342:107"/>only him but all the world. You will paſs for young, and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby ſooner old. Finally, you will have your beauty admired, and every one flouts you: you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without ſome ſhame look either upon your friends, and ſuch as are your equals, nor upon your own chambermayd; and your very look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs makes you bluſh.</p>
                     <p>But I will not ſtay upon theſe Reaſons. There are others yet more ſtrong and much more conſiderable. For you ſin againſt God; you loſe your ſhamefac'dneſs which is the glory of your Sex; you enkindle criminal flames in the hearts of men, and you render your ſelves like to thoſe infamous ſacrifices of publick unchaſtity: Conſider then with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention all theſe advices I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you: Deſpiſe for the future theſe Diabolical ornaments: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe falſe embelliſhments, or rather theſe true deformities, to embuſy your ſelf no longer but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150342:108"/>upon that interiour and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beauty of the Soul, which the Angels deſire, which God loves, and which will be precious and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, to whom you are united by a ſacred tye.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>You have, my Siſter, in theſe words of this great Saint, all that is neceſſary to ſtrengthen your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt the evil inclination which they of your Sex have to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fair and to pleaſe.

                  <q>

                     <p>Who is he, among all you, who liſten unto me, (adds this Father); that can ſay by heart either one Pſalm, or any other part of the Scripture, if I ſhould demand it of him? there would not one be found; and which is more to be deplored, in this indifference for ſacred things, you have at the ſame time an ardour which out-paſſes that of fire it ſelf, for ſuch deteſtable things as are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy of the devils. For if any one ſhould entreat you on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to recite ſome one of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous ſongs and of theſe ſhameful and Diabolical Odes, there would many be found who have learned them with care, and who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them with pleaſure.</p>

Thoſe ſongs which paſs for the moſt honeſt, include oftentimes the moſt ſubtil poyſon. And if you examine all them you have ever heard, you will obſerve that there are few which wound not either truth or charity; whether it be in giving falſe prayſes to things and perſons which deſerve them not, or whether it be in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the honour and the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Neighbour, you will mark, that there are ſcarcely any which are not full of bitter backbitings and ſlanders, and which are not bloudy Satyrs, ſparing neither the ſacred perſons of Soveraigns, nor of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, nor of the moſt innocent and pious people: you will perceive that there are hardly any which ſerve not either to expreſs irregular paſſions or to entertain them; that there are few or none which flatter not the ſaid

                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding, how many Fathers and Mothers are there, who ſuffer without any ſcruple, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to fill their ſpirits and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories with theſe ſongs, which they ſing with pleaſure in their preſence, and by their free and frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of them, accuſtome themſelves inſenſibly to loſe their ſhamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though they would bluſh to hear them in a more advanced age, if they had not timely inured them to this corrupted language.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lactantius,</hi> in the abridgment he

He adds, that they inſtill a diſguſt of all holy things, and above all, of the ſacred Scriptures; becauſe corrupted nature finding nothing there which flatters her, becomes diſtaſted, and unjuſtly prefers thoſe wretched verſes and ſongs, which foment and entertain its paſſions, before the ſolid Truths which thoſe holy Books diſcover unto it, and which condemn its irregularities.</q>

                  <p>What care then ought not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers to take, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their children from this plague which infects almoſt the whole world? what crime do they not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, not only when they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:150342:111"/>to hear them ſung by their children, but even themſelves teach them to ſing them? St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Parents who cauſed their Children to eat meats offered to Idols, makes the children utter theſe aſtoniſhing words: <hi>Our own Fathers have been our Murderers.</hi> And St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> explicating this paſſage, ſays, <q>that although theſe children having no ſhare in this criminal action by their own will, did not really dye in their ſoul; yet their Fathers ceaſed not to be their Murderers; becauſe foraſmuch as depended on them, they cauſed their ſouls to dye ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How much more culpable are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who teach their children ſongs of detraction or of obſcenity, then theſe whom St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> blames? For ſurely the meats offered to Idols are the creatures of God: but theſe Songs are the productions of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who compoſes them by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Thoſe meats did not really
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:150342:111"/>corrupt either the ſoul or the body of the Children, they only paſſed through them like other victuals, without leaving in them any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant impreſſion: whereas theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious ſongs corrupt the ſpirit of ſuch as ſing them, and ſticking cloſe to their memory, prove a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them as long as they live.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>'TIs not yet enough, my Siſter, to watch over the tender years of your children, to hinder them from learning accurſed ſonnets: you muſt furthermore when they are more advanced in age, and capable to apply themſelves to reading, keep carefully from them the Romances and other Books of that nature, which only ſerve to inſtill the ſpirit of the world into their mindes, and to ruine in them the ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>I cannot better make you compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the importance of this Advice, then by relating to you the words of St. <hi>Tereſa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">St. <hi>Tereſa</hi> c. 2. of her life.</note> wherein you will ſee how dangerous it is for Mothers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their children in this point, and for themſelves to take pleaſure
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150342:114"/>in theſe kinde of Lectures, which charming the ſpirit by agreeable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, corrupt the heart with real ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>It ſeems to me, ſays ſhe, that what I am going about to relate, was to me very prejudiciall. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſometimes the great evil done by Parents to their children in not endeavouring with all their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to place continually before their eyes the objects of virtue. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my Mother was as virtuous as I now have declared her, yet when I had attained the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I remember very little, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing at all of her good qualities; whereas the bad ones which I obſerved in her, did ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt and dammage me.</p>
                     <p>She was delighted with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Romances; but this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement was not to her ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as it was to me, becauſe ſhe loſt no more time than what ſhe employed in reading them, and that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:150342:115"/>perhaps ſhe did it only to untire her ſelf from the weariſome cares of her family, and to hinder her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from worſe employments: but as for me, although my Father was ſo much againſt it, that we were forced to take care he might not perceive it, I ceaſed not to keep on my ordinary cuſtom of reading theſe Books, and how ſmall ſoever this fault was in my Mother, it failed not to cool my good deſires, and was the cauſe of my falling inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into other defects.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemed to me, that it was not evil to loſe many hours of the day, and of the night, in ſo vain an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, although I hid my ſelf from my Father; and I was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted with the extreame pleaſure I took in it, that methought I could not be content if I had not ſome new Romance in my hands.</p>
                     <p>I began to imitate the Mode, to take delight in being well dreſſed, to take great care of my hands, to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:150342:115"/>make uſe of the moſt excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes; in a word, to affect all the vain trimmings which my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on permitted, and which my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity invented in a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Indeed my intention was not bad; for I would not in the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate paſſion which I had to be decent, give any occaſion to any perſon of the world to offend God; but I now acknowledge how far theſe things, which during ſeveral years ſpace appeared to me inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, are effectually and really cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I do not think, my Siſter, that any thing needs to be added to theſe words to make you abhor the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Romances; ſince they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo cleerly the greateſt part of the bad effects which theſe fabulous Hiſtories produce, which the idleneſs and licentiouſneſs of theſe later times have invented to nouriſh and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the moſt dangerous paſſions.</p>
                  <p>For you ſee in the words and in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:150342:116"/>the example of this holy woman, how theſe unhappy lectures charm in ſuch ſort the ſpirits of young people by the pernicious ſweetneſs and the diſmal pleaſure they preſent unto them, that they neglect all other exerciſes to tye themſelves to this; that they make it their only and their principal buſineſs; and that they employ the days and the nights, even againſt the will of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to ſatisfy the curioſity which the connexion of the diverſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they meet with in thoſe books, excites more and more in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as they proceed in the reading thereof.</p>
                  <p>You ſee how theſe empoyſoned Lectures change all the good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they received from nature; how they chill by little and little the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires they had for goodneſs; and how they baniſh in a ſhort time out of their Soul all that was there of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity and of virtue.</p>
                  <p>You ſee how they inſtill into their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150342:116"/>Readers the love and eſteem of all worldly vanities; how they teach them to ſeek out means whereby to pleaſe the world, to flatter their ſenſes, to trick up themſelves, to render themſelves pleaſing, to ſtay and deceive the eyes; finally, to finde out diſguiſes and cunnings to conceal that wherein the body is defective, and to place in its higheſt ſplendour whatever may make for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes one is ſurprized to ſee young girls educated in a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs and in great modeſty, take all on a ſudden an air full of vanity and gallanterie, and to make ſhew of no other ardour than for that which the world eſteems, and which God abominates. One is aſtoniſhed at this deplorable change; and ſince they had not as yet haunted compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, one knows not well to what it may be attributed. 'Tis that Fathers and Mothers have not watched over them to hinder their reading of theſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:150342:117"/>dangerous books, which have inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into them this ſecret vanity, and this deſire to raiſe in them who look upon them thoſe paſſions for which they conceived ſo high an eſteem, by ſeeing them expreſſed ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in thoſe Books. Thoſe feigned and imaginary adventures have charmed their hearts. They have redoubled the ardours of their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and have permitted to paſs firſt into their ſouls, and afterwards into their geſtures, and into their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all the motions they have found regiſtred of thoſe fabulous Ladies. They have eſpouſed their Maxims, their ſpirit, their conduct, their language, and all their manners of proceedings. They have there learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be ſo untractable, nor ſo ſevere, to be ſomewhat tender and compaſſionate; to ſuffer themſelves to be coneerned in the ſervices, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhings, kindneſſes and tears of their wooers; finally, to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from themſelves, and to cloak
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150342:117"/>the motions of a love which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally irregular with the appearances of a civil honeſty, and of an eaſy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and gay humour and diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Be vigilant therefore my Siſter, and carefully hinder your Children from falling into this dangerous ſnare, which the devil lays to entrap their Innocence. <q>Let them not be hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with this diſmal torrent, which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays,
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 1. <hi>Confes.</hi> c. 16.</note> drags along the children of <hi>Eve</hi> into that vaſt and dangerous ſea, out of which they ſcarcely (ſays this Saint) can eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and ſave themſelves, who paſs over upon the wood of the Croſs of Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And let them not ſay, (adds this Father,) that in theſe Books they may learn the purity of the language, and that it is from them that this eloquence is to be ſucked which is ſo neceſſary to perſwade what one deſires, and to expreſs with a grace ones adviſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:150342:118"/>You ought to take grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care of the purity of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens heart than of that of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</q> And although there may be found good things in thoſe books intermixed with the bad,
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Jerome</hi> to <hi>Leta.</hi>
                     </note> yet (as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> obſerves upon the ſubject of dangerous books) <q>one needs much diſcretion to ſeek and finde out gold in the dirt, and one is ofttimes in danger to defile himſelf in this ſearch without finding what they look for.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all, there are now an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Books of Piety much better written, from which your children may draw together, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and the love of Chriſtian Verities, true Eloquence, and where they may finde all the graces of the Language without any need of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in fabulous Hiſtories, which are only capable to quench Charity in their ſouls, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle there forreign flames, which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:150342:118"/>will conſume by little and little all the feelings of piety which you have endeavoured to inſtil into them.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150342:123"/>to remedies, and ſays, <q>that as remedies profit not the body but when they are uſed according to the advice of the Phyſitian, and that on the contrary they ſerve oftentimes to entertain the diſeaſe when they are taken contrary to his advice: So all that we do according to the rules which Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Phyſitian of our Souls, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto us, contributes to their health and ſerves them for a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: whereas that which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his ſpirit and to his rules, inſenſibly weakens and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys her ſtrength. It follows then, concludes this holy Doctour, that a Chriſtian ſhould place all his joy in a good conſcience, and not in Feaſtings, in Dancings, and in worldly Meetings. For the chaſtity is not in ſecurity, and the pleaſure which allures us ought to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected when the Dance is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion or the end of the divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſeek for. <hi>There is no one,</hi>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:150342:124"/>ſaid an Ancient, <hi>who dances, being ſober, unleſs he has loſt his wit.</hi> If according to the very Pagan-wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, drunkenneſs or folly is the cauſe of Dancing, what can we think the ſacred Scripture would inſinuate unto us when it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto us the Fore-runner of Chriſt Jeſus condemned to death at the deſire of a Dancer, but that the pleaſure which <hi>Herod</hi> took to ſee the Daughter of <hi>Herodias</hi> dance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, was more unfortunate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, than the ſacrilegious reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had of the freedom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that Saint had preſumed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then after he had made reflexion upon the greatneſs of the crime wherein this Prince was engaged, having been as it were enchanted by this unhappy dance, and by the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Girl in daring to dance before him, he adds theſe words: <q>What could this Daughter learn of an inceſtuous Mother but to loſe all
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150342:124"/>Modeſty? In effect, is there any thing more proper to excite ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſſions, than to diſcover, as they do in dancing, thoſe parts of the body which nature and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility oblige to hide; then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the eyes with a certain artifice, and cauſe the looks to agree with the undecent poſtures of the body; and then to mark with the head and all the reſt of the body the motions of a diſſolute cadency?</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>Shall one wonder after this, if people are ſo eaſily engaged amidſt the dance to commit the greateſt crimes? And what ſtayedneſs or what remainder of modeſty can there be among the tintamars and the confuſed noyſes they make in ſinging, capering, and abandoning themſelves to a diſſolution, which diſhonours Chriſtianity? What ſay you Chriſtian Mothers at the ſight of ſo tragical a hiſtory? See you not in this example what you ſhould teach your daughters to avoid, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:150342:125"/>that it is for unchaſte and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Parents, to permit their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to dance, and not for them who are chaſte and faithful to their Bridegroom, who ſhould teach their daughters to love virtue and not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dancing.</q>
                  <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> confirms this truth,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chryſoſt. hom.</hi> 48. <hi>in Matth.</hi>
                     </note> when making reflexion upon this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he ſays, <q>That this daughter of <hi>Herodias</hi> was doubly criminal; firſt, in that ſhe danced; ſecondly, in that ſhe pleaſed <hi>Herod,</hi> and ſo pleaſed him as that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Murder for the price of her dance.</q> And then after he had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the dance was the ſnare by which the devil cauſed this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prince to fall into ſo horrid a crime, he ſays, <q>That it was alſo the devil who made this Girl dance with ſuch a grace, that <hi>Herod</hi> was charmed and blindely abandoned himſelf to his paſſion. For, adds he, the devil is ever found where-ever
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:150342:125"/>is dancing. God hath not given us feet for ſo ſhamefull a uſe, but to march with modeſty. He hath not given them to us that we ſhould caper like thoſe brute beaſts which skip up and down, and which it ſeems women deſire to imitate in their dancing, but to have place in the quire of Angels. Now if the Body is diſhonoured by theſe unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent geſtures, how much more is the ſoul thereby defiled? Dances are the ſports of devils. His mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and his vaſſals make them their divertiſement and their pleaſure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that no one may fancy that thoſe words cannot be applied to ſuch dances as are common among world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, becauſe they have not always to our eyes ſuch diſmal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as theſe; yet as this holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour obſerves, <q>There are at this day many ſuch Feaſts, and Balls, and ſuch murdering dances. They kill not there the bleſſed Precurſour, but the very Members of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:150342:126"/>and in a manner which is yet more cruel; they preſent not there a head in a platter for the price of a dance; but they render the <hi>major</hi> part of ſuch as are there preſent the ſlaves of brutiſh pleaſures: and by engaging them in criminal paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they kill them, not by cutting off the head of their Body, but by ſeparating their Soul from Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Avoid therefore, my Siſter, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely theſe Balls, theſe Dances, and theſe miſerable Meetings. Fly them as a Plague, the poyſon whereof is more mortal to ſouls, than that contagion is to bodies. Let no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration oblige you to frequent them: Conſider before God their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable danger; and practiſe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of your Children that which St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> notes we daily do for the conſervation of worldly goods. <q>Surely, ſays this Father, when we ſee a ſervant bearing about an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Torch, we ſeriouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:150342:126"/>him to carry it into places where there is ſtraw, hay, or ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter, for fear leſt when they leaſt dream of it, a ſpark ſhould fall into it and fire the whole houſe. Let's uſe the ſame precaution towards our Children, and let's not carry their eyes to ſuch places where are found licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Damoſells, pratling Girls, and ſhameleſs perſons. But if there are ſuch people at home with us, or dwelling in our neighbourhood, or where-ever they be, let us expreſly forbid our Children to look upon them, or to have with them any commerce or converſation; for fear leſt ſome ſmall ſpark falling into the Soul of theſe young people ſhould cauſe a general conflagration, and an irreparable dammage.</q>

                  <p>IF the fear of cauſing dangerous paſſions to ſpring up in the heart of your Children, obliges you to keep them from the Meetings and Aſſemblies whereof we have now ſpoken; ſurely this ſame fear indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably engages you never to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to frequent Comedies.</p>
                  <p>There is no diſorder which the Fathers of the Church have beaten down oftner and with more zeal than the love of ſhews and ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. We finde in infinite places of their Writings, the marks of their extreme care againſt this pernicious inclination, which began in their time to corrupt the Innocence and the Chaſtity of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>They conſider them as an inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil, who hath cauſed Theatres to be erected in the Towns,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:150342:127"/>to effeminate the hearts of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Chriſt Jeſus, and to make them loſe their ſtrength and their generoſity.</p>
                  <p>They deplore the blindneſs of ſuch as believe there's no harm in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with pleaſure at repreſentations, from which they can bring back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſhameful imaginations and criminal deſignes.</p>
                  <p>They lay open the indiſpenſable obligation one hath to quit the near occaſions of incontinence: They call theſe Aſſemblies the Schools and the publick ſources of impurity, and they decry them as the Feaſts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: they oblige them who have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted thereat to purify themſelves by repentance before they enter into the Church: Finally, they make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions ſo ſad and ſo horrible of the ſtate wherein the ſpectatours are found at their going forth from theſe divertiſements, that one cannot reade them without trembling, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being aſtoniſhed at the dreadful
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:150342:128"/>blindneſs of men, who abhor not the greateſt crimes but when they are not common, and who not only ceaſe to contradict them, but which oft times they even make to paſs for innocent actions.</p>
                  <p>For ſurely notwithſtanding the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of theſe great Saints, and of them who have followed them to ſtifle this diſorder; it is ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in theſe laſt ages by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption which is crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the faithful, that it paſſes now for an honeſt divertiſement, and that Comedies which are the ſhame and the confuſion of Chriſtianiſm, are become the ſerious occupation of the major part of Chriſtians. That which more afflicts me, ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <q>S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">St. <hi>Chriſt. ſer.</hi> 8. <hi>in Matth.</hi>
                        </note> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this diſorder, is, that this evil being ſo great, is not eſteemed an evil.</q> And this is it which obliges you, my Siſter, to take more care to hinder your Children from ſetting their
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:150342:128"/>affection upon theſe wretched ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles.</p>
                  <p>I well know that it is pretended, that there is much difference between the Comedies of theſe times and thoſe which the holy Fathers thus highly condemned in theirs; and that if thoſe againſt which they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo great zeal, deſerved the blame they laid upon them, theſe which are now adays repreſented upon the ſtages, cannot be ſufficiently prayſed, <hi>becauſe they contain for the moſt part nothing but examples of Innocence, of virtue and of Piety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But with however ſpecious a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text the Authors of theſe Plays cover themſelves, and however pure and holy may be their intentions; there is nevertheleſs ſuch a mixture in their Works, and the Saints alſo whom they bring upon the Theatre teſtify there ſo much tenderneſs, touching love, which is the predominant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Comedies, that it is very hard for the hearers not to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:150342:129"/>and that inſtead of ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtage by the actions of the Martyrs there repreſented, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane not the ſanctity of their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings by the amorous ſictions which they there intermingle.</p>
                  <p>And in effect, if they there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Martyrdom of a Virgin-Saint,
<note place="margin">Theodora.</note> muſt it not be ſome Intrigue of love which makes her die? And are they not conſtrained to ſuppoſe that another Lady is deſperately in love with the young Prince who hath a violent paſſion for the Saint, and that an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Mother ſpares not the Blood of this Saint to fatisfy the paſſion of that poor wretch.</p>
                  <p>And even the Saint in the ſequel of the Play comes laſtly to diſcover the ſecret paſſion ſhe hath for a young man: and although the Authour makes her beat it down, yet ſhe ceaſes not to give place to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to juſtify in themſelves by her example the paſſion they reſent, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:150342:129"/>to entertain it under pretext of not conſenting thereto. They learn of her to look upon the motions of an irregular Love as the impreſſions which in their birth form braveſt paſſions. And the young man whom ſhe loves, (as Chriſtian as he is, and ready to endure death for the defence of the Faith and of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Saint,) ceaſes not to perſwade her to eſpouſe this young Pagan-Prince who loves her: So that if one ſees in this Piece of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry in the perſon of a Virgin-Saint, Faith triumphing over the moſt ſhamefull puniſhments; one there ſees at the ſame time profane Love triumphing over many wretches which it hath ſubjected to it ſelf, and purſuing even to death a holy Virgin, and a generous Martyr. One there beholds the motion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity, which obliges this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Saint to expoſe his life for the defence of the purity of that Virgin-Saint, ſo much obſcured by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:150342:130"/>the feigned paſſion which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour foiſts into his and into her expreſſions, that the hearers know no more then the actors whom he introduces on the Stage.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether it is the zeal of a lover or the fury of the Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although the Saint declare himſelf in the ſequel that he acted not in this occaſion but by a motive of Chriſtian generoſity, yet this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares mixed with ſo many tender and paſſionate words, and with ſo many circumſtances which tend to turn away the ſpirit from conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and to carry it on to profane Love, that whatever remains in the minde of the Spectatours is a high idea of the ſtrong paſſion which this Lover had for the perſon he loved.</p>
                  <p>Behold what are theſe <hi>examples of Innocence, of Virtue, and of Piety,</hi> they ſo much brag of: But rather behold how in the Comedies they make uſe of Chriſtian generoſity and charity which the Saints made appear in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:150342:130"/>their actions, to raiſe up the luſtre of profane love, and to give it an eſteem, and to excite its flames in the heart of the Spectatours.</p>
                  <p>But, Siſter, to make you ſee yet more cleerly how meerly imaginary the difference is, which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be between the Comedies of theſe our times and the Spectacles of the Ancient; and that it is neither <hi>Scruple</hi> nor <hi>Capriciouſneſs</hi> but a true zeal which moves them who blame them thus to decry them; you muſt obſerve that the Fathers of the Church have ſcarcely ſaid any thing againſt the adheſion which people had in their days to ſpectacles, which may not be applied with much juſtice to the Comedies of our time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the Book he made of Shews and Spectacles, undertakes to ſhew that theſe divertiſements could not be accomodated to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Religion we profeſs, and to the duties of a Chriſtian: that the reaſon why they have ſo many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:150342:131"/>is the fear man hath of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the number of his pleaſures diminiſhed: that it is in vain to fancy that Chriſtians did not abſtain from them, but becauſe they being reſolved to ſuffer death for the Faith, renounced all the pleaſures of life, to the end they might leſs love it, and not be retained by pleaſures, which are as it were fetters that faſten us to it; but that they abſtained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although theſe divertiſements are not forbidden in expreſs terms in the ſacred Scripture, yet they ceaſe not to be there ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the paſſages which forbid us to follow the irregular deſires of covetouſneſs, and of ſatisfying our Paſſions. <q>For it is certain (ſays this learned man) that the ſeeking of pleaſures is one of the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions of man,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tertul.</hi> l. <hi>de ſpectat.</hi> c. 4.</note> and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong pleaſures that of ſpectacles is one of them which moſt tranſport him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:150342:131"/>
                  <p>Secondly, in the paſſages which oblige us to tend always to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which conſiſts in the ſubjection of Paſſions to grace: which cannot be acquired but by baniſhing from the ſpirit all that may ſerve to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them and to entertain them.</p>
                  <q>Whereas, ſays he, <hi>chap.</hi> 15.16. Spectacles on the contrary make the paſſions revive in the hearts of the moſt mortified perſons, they re ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them, they fortify them, and after they have put them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them as it were out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they excite in them moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hatred, of love, of joy, of ſadneſs, which are by ſo much more irregular, by how much one often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times loves what they ſhould hate or which deſerves no eſteem, and one hates on the contrary that which they are not permitted to hate.</q>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the paſſages of ſacred Writ, which forbid us the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, and the leaſt diſhoneſt or frivolous words. <q>For why, (ſays
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:150342:132"/>this great man,) <hi>chap.</hi> 17. ſhould it be permitted to a Chriſtian to ſee repreſented on a Theatre ſuch things as he is not permitted ſo much as to think of, and to hear that ſpoken of there which ought no where be once named before him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhews, that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles may not be permitted to Chriſtians: Firſt, by the judgement which men make of ſuch as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, and who paſs in their opinion for infamous perſons. <hi>chap.</hi> 21. Secondly, by the judgement which God, himſelf gives of them, there being nothing in the ſpectacles which he condemns not. <hi>chap.</hi> 23. Thirdly, becauſe the ſaid ſpectacles are of the number of the pomps of the devil, which we have renounced by our Baptiſm. <hi>chap.</hi> 24. Fourthly, becauſe the very Pagans judged that a man was become a Chriſtian when he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf from them, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that the inſtinct of Chriſtian
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:150342:132"/>Piety, removed from the Theatre all ſuch as profeſſed it. <hi>chap.</hi> 25. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve there the feelings of piety which a Chriſtian ought always to have in his heart. Sixthly, becauſe all the objects there repreſented are only proper to divert him from God and to link him to the creature. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, becauſe it is ridiculous to pretend that one may make good uſe thereof, and to do it in reverence to God. <hi>chap.</hi> 27. Eighthly, becauſe ſuppoſing there were ſome of them honeſt, Chriſtians ought always to conſider them no otherwiſe then as empoyſoned honey, whereof they cannot taſte without danger of death. <hi>chap.</hi> 29. Finally, becauſe the ſtate of a Chriſtian in this life is to fly all ſorts of pleaſures, and to cauſe all his joy to conſiſt in the tears of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, in the pardon of his ſins, in the knowledge of truth, and in the contempt of pleaſures even the moſt innocent and the moſt lawful.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:150342:133"/>
                  <p>What is there, my Siſter, in all this, which this great man alledges againſt the ſhews and ſpectacles of the ancient, which may not be ſaid of the Comedies of theſe days? Are the Chriſtians of theſe times leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged than they of the time of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> to quit the paſſions of the world, and to mortify in themſelves the deſires which provoke them to ſeek for pleaſures and divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
                  <p>Are they leſs bound then they of the firſt ages to labour for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Evangelical Perfection, to weaken and conquer the paſſions of the fleſh, and to ſhun the objects which excite them, which entertain them, and which ſtrengthen them?</p>
                  <p>Are they leſs obliged than thoſe of former ages to fly all that may wound the purity which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them? And their Eyes and Ears muſt they be leſs chaſte than their Tongues, which are not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak any vain and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:150342:133"/>word, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly pronounces?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Comedians of theſe times, are they of more conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world than thoſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages? <q>What a corruption is it, ſays <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tertul.</hi> c. 22.</note> to love them whom the publick laws condemn; to approve of them whom they deſpiſe; to extoll an art and an employment at the ſame time when they are branded with infamy who did addict themſelves unto it?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is there in Comedies which can be pleaſing to Gods eyes? Is it the pomp and the magnificence of the cloaths? Is it the dexterity of the Actors to excite in themſelves and in others criminal paſſions? Is it the induſtry wherewith the muſical Airs are accomodated to the ſubjects, and rendred proper to ſtrengthen the ſaid paſſions? Is it the skill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Poet hath diſguiſed the truth by mixing Fabulous fictions
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:150342:134"/>and imaginary accidents? the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of truth, ſays <hi>Tertullian, chap.</hi> 23. loves not lies: and whatever is feigned, paſſes before him for a ſpice of Adultery.</p>
                  <p>They who renounce the world, and are truly touched with a deſire to live to God, do they not avoid Comedies as very dangerous rocks? And is it not acknowledged that they have changed their life, and that they are (as may be ſaid) become Chriſtians a ſecond time, in that they refuſe to be found in thoſe places, which they too well know have been unfortunate unto them?</p>
                  <p>Will a Chriſtian conſerve in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie the feelings he ought to have always in his heart; and will he have his ſpirit raiſed towards God in an Aſſembly, where, ſays <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, chap.</hi> 25. <hi>there is nothing of God,</hi> and at a time when all the ſenſes are embuſied to feed upon the vain pleaſure which is there preſented unto them, and where the thoughts
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:150342:134"/>are applyed to the geſtures, to the Words, and to the motions of the Actors?</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Tertullian</hi> eſteemed to be the greateſt ſcandal which was found in the ſpectacles of Pagans, is it not met withall in Comedies? Men and Women, young Gallants and young Girls, meet they not there together, and appear they not there with all the gaity and pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs poſſible? Go they not thither (as this great man ſays) with this ſole deſign and diſpoſition to ſee there and to be there ſeen? And the approbation they give with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon voice to the Comedians, and the joy they feel to meet together in the ſame opinions, are they not as ſo many ſparks which encreaſe the ſecret fire burning in their hearts? Inſomuch, as one may ſay, that each one of them after his manner acts there his part, and that ofttimes the Actors do but repreſent what paſſes ſecretly among the perſons who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them.</p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:150342:135"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> therefore ſays nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpectacles of the Ancient, which may not be applied with juſtice to the Comedies of our times. And in this ſort, my Siſter, if I feared not to extend my ſelf too far, (having not undertaken to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Comedies but only to ſhew you the obligation you have to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your Children from them), I could make it manifeſt unto you, that all which St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of that Treatiſe of <hi>Spectacles,</hi> which is among his Works; All that <hi>Salvian,</hi> and all that the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church have ſaid againſt the ſhews and ſpectacles of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, fall naturally upon the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of our times.</p>
                  <p>I could make you ſee, that they do at this day no leſs profane the ſacred Myſteries, in going to a Comedie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the days in which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, <hi>and in carrying thither</hi> (as one may ſay) <hi>the Euchariſt yet perſent in their boſome:</hi> that they ought at this

                  <p>I well know that the Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted particularly upon that, That there was then no ſpectacle which was not dedicated to ſome falſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and which had not in its <hi>origin</hi> or in its execution ſomething of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>But I alſo know, that if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 5.2. the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion one hath to riches is a ſpice of Idolatry; that which one hath to pleaſure is by ſo much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by how much it engages the man to ſacrifice himſelf to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:150342:136"/>which is the moſt infamous of all the Idols.</p>
                  <p>I know that St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ſaid,

                  <p>Thus they who would render the Comedie Chriſtian by interweaving therein the actions of Saints, have proceeded ſomewhat like to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> relates) ſeeing that the Roman Cenſours had frequently cauſed the Theatres to be pulled down,

                     <p>Yes, my Brethren, adds this Saint, it is the Devil who hath made an art of theſe divertiſements and of theſe Plays, to draw to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Soldiers of Chriſt Jeſus, and to ſlacken all the vigour and as it were the ſinews of their Virtue. 'Tis for this end that he hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Theatres to be ſet up in publick places, and that exerciſing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thoſe Bouffons and Jeaſters, he makes uſe of them as of a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence wherewith he infects the whole City. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath forbidden us impertinent words, and ſuch as aym only at a vain divertiſement; but the devil perſwades us to love the one and the other.</p>
                     <p>That which is yet more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is the ſubject for which they tranſport themſelves into theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate laughters. For as ſoon as the ridiculous Bouffons have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome blaſphemy, or ſome diſhoneſt word, one may ſee the greateſt fools raviſhed with joy, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:150342:138"/>tranſported into lowd Laughters: They applaud them for what they ſhould ſtone them: and they draw thus upon themſelves, by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable pleaſure, the puniſhment of an eternal fire. For by prayſing them for ſuch follies, they perſwade them to do them, and they render themſelves yet more then them worthy of the condemnation which they have deſerved. If all the world would agree not to behold their fopperies, they would quickly leave them off: but when they ſee you daily to abandon your employs, your labours, and what money you can ſcrape up; in a word, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all to aſſiſt at theſe ſhews, they redouble their eagerneſs and apply themſelves much more to theſe fooleries.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>You ſee, my Siſter, that St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> as well as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> doth not only condemn Comedies becauſe of their diſſolution and impurity; but moreover becauſe it is not permitted
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:150342:138"/>to Chriſtians to paſs the time in Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and divertiſements, and in ſuch delights as are inſeparable from theſe ſpectacles; that they condemn them becauſe one cannot chuſe but give an approbation and an applauſe to things for which the faithfull ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an extreme horrour; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <q>(as the ſame Saint adds) they who aſſiſt at theſe ſhews, entertain the licentious life of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, animate them by their admirations, by their applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by their prayſes; thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring by all means to beautify and exalt this work of the Devil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This without doubt moved <hi>Salvian</hi> to ſay,

                     <q>That it is as a kinde of apoſtaſy from the Faith, and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal prevarication from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, to go to a Comedie. For what is, ſays he, the firſt profeſſion which Chriſtians make in Baptiſm? Is it not to renounce the devil, his Pomps, and his ſhews,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:150342:139"/>and all his works? The ſpectacles then and the pomps are according to our own confeſſion the works of the devil.

                  </p>
                  <p>And it is ſo true, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go to Comedies without enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <q>ones ſelf voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the tyranny of the devil,

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:150342:140"/>who afflicts himſelf at the loſs of a pernicious pleaſure and of a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable felicity. Finally, you muſt, becauſe one takes no pleaſure, as the ſame Saint marks, in ſeeing Comedies, unleſs one is moved with thoſe Poetical adventures which are there repreſented, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with nevertheleſs one is by ſo much more moved, by how much one is leſs cured of his paſſions.</q> So that by how much your Children ſhall teſtify more ardour for Comedies, by ſo much the leſs you are to permit them to go to them; becauſe this their eagerneſs is an evident ſigne of the inclination they have to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to pomp, and to ſenſuality, to wantonneſs, to idleneſs, to effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to the arts and diſguiſes which triumph upon the Stages, and which you ought to endeavour to baniſh from their heart.</p>

                  <p>ST. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> advertiſes the Faithfull <q>to take heed leſt in deſiring to relax their ſpirit, they break not all the harmony and all the concert of their good works.</q> This advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by ſo much more neceſſary in theſe our days, by how much the <hi>major</hi> part of Chriſtians live in a continual relaxation, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diverting themſelves only as much as is needfull for them in order to enable them afterwards to follow their employments with more eaſe and attention, they make their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements their whole buſineſs and occupation. You ought therefore to forget nothing, my Siſter, to fortify your children againſt this diſorder, and to hinder them from engaging themſelves inſenſibly in this ſoft and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:150342:141"/>delicious way of living, which is ſo common among the people of the world.</p>
                  <p>To ſee the manner of their life and converſation, it ſeems they were born only for pleaſure; and that the advantages they have above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either by the nobility of their deſcent, or by the great riches they poſſeſs, give them a right to remain in an idleneſs altogether profane, and in a wretchleſneſs altogether op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the life of true Chriſtians, which ought to be all vigilant and all laborious.</p>
                  <p>Theſe perſons upon pretext that they feel I know not what averſion from all groſs and ſhameful crimes, and that they propoſe to themſelves only to paſs pleaſantly each day, make no ſcruple to conſume days and nights in vain converſations, in walkings abroad, in banquets, and in gaming; without fearing that the freedom they give to their ſenſes and to their deſires in all theſe things,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:150342:142"/>ſhould afford them the occaſions of being corrupted, wherewith it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but that they are inceſſantly accompanied.</p>
                  <p>I pretend not, Siſter, to ſtay here in order to make you ſee the illuſion of this conduct, nor the obligation which all the faithful have to avoid it, I have already ſhewed it in the ſecond Chapter of this Book: and I know that you are, thanks be to God, fully convinced thereof. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire only to encourage you to beat down timely in your children the paſſions which cauſe theſe irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and particularly that of play and gaming, which exerciſes at this day in the world ſo great a tyranny over mens ſpirits, and which cauſes ſuch dreadful evils.</p>
                  <p>I avouch unto you, my Siſter, that I cannot comprehend how this paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could get poſſeſſion of ſo many perſons, and how the effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſhould not make them abhor it, and ſhould not have yet ſtopped
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:150342:142"/>its courſe. For what exceſſes doth not the love of gaming cauſe to them who abandon themſelves unto it? Doth it not ſtifle in them by little and little all the feelings of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, of charity towards their children, their Domeſticks and their Neighbour, and of the love one owes to himſelf? This paſſion enchants them in ſuch ſort by the pleaſure they finde in it, or by the hope of gain wherewith they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they forget all things, that they let ſlip the hours which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven moſt neceſſary for repoſe, that they loſe their drink and meat, that they embuſy their mindes only upon that which they imagine to have been the cauſe of their gain or of their loſs.</p>
                  <p>They have no more guſt for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of life: the exerciſes of piety are irkſom unto them. They apply themſelves no longer to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or if they do, it is with a ſpirit full of perplexity, diſquiet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:150342:143"/>as they themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for the loſſes they have ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or with a falſe joy for the gain which hath befallen them. And if they pretend an indifferency to win or loſe, they ceaſe not at leaſt to ſhew an extreme impatience to return to their play and gaming.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of ſanctifying the Sundays and Holy-days, they profane them, as if they had no ſenſe of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. They know no more, what it is to aſſiſt at the Divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or to hear the Word of God; or if they go to the great Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is to make there new Matches, and to engage themſelves afterwards in gaming with more eagerneſs and with leſs ſcruple: as if people of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſuch as have means enough to play away, were therefore diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall in the duties of piety and in the keeping of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or that it were permitted them to make no diſtinction between Holy-days and others, than by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:150342:143"/>at a low Maſs, and that alſo in ſuch a manner as that they make ſo little piety appear, that it is ſiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſeek rather to diſcharge themſelves of a burden, than to acquit themſelves lawfully of a duty.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall I ſay, Siſter, of the power which gaming hath to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, to ſtrengthen, and to entertain the moſt criminal paſſions? Doth not vanity ſlide ordinarily into gain? and do not they fancy that to be due to their own addreſs and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which they only owe for the moſt part to hap-hazard? Anger, Envy, Spight, Rage and Fury, do they not flaſh out in loſings and in bad ſucceſs? and all the other paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do they not follow one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this manner? Do we not ſee them in leſs than an hours ſpace to appear with all their different moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the geſtures, in the words, and in all the actions of theſe Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? They are dejected and jolly, moderate and tranſported almoſt in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:150342:144"/>the ſame moment. And they who conſerve outwardly a greater equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and who ſtrive to keep more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ceaſe not whether they will or no to be agitated interiourly with all theſe violent paſſions.</p>
                  <p>I let alone the Lies, the Injuſtices, and the Infidelities which are there committed; the Blaſphemies and the execrable Oaths wherewith they are tranſported; the Quarrels, the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the Murders which happen, and all the other accurſed effects which the paſſion of Play ordinarily produces: The inability into which they bring themſelves to aſiſt the poor in their need, and the harſhneſs they ſhew towars them whilſt they rob from their neceſſity the money which they play away, is alone an evil great enough to perſwade Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to an averſion from Gaming.</p>
                  <p>But the love of Play ſtays not here: It makes the perſons who abandon themſelves unto it to violate other Duties, which are to them (as we
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:150342:144"/>may ſay) much more eſſentiall and much more indiſpenſable. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men leave their houſes and leave the care of their family to ſuch domeſticks who have oft-times only an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piety and fidelity, and which diſſipate under hand all their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. They neglect the Education of their children, and commit them to the care of ſervants, or of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who corrupt their ſpirit, and who frequently engage them in ſuch diſorders, as ſtay with them all the reſt of their life time.</p>
                  <p>The men on their ſide expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oftentimes to loſe the means without which they cannot make their Family to ſubſiſt as they are obliged, nor acquit themſelves of their Debts. They render themſelves uſeleſs to the publick, there being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince nor even particular perſon who will entruſt his goods or his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the hands of a man who loves Play and Gaming. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their honours, their offices, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:150342:145"/>their dignities; and there are but too many illuſtrious Families which have been ruined by Play, or which yet reſent the loſſes of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it is Gaming which cauſes Children ſo frequently to violate the reſpect they owe to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; which troubles the <hi>major</hi> part of Families; which ſeparates Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands from their Wives; and which dividing them whom God hath uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an indiſſoluble tye, cauſes them oftentimes to fail in the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which they owe to each other. How many Wives are there, who having not wherewithall to ſatisfy the love they bear to Play, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a Husband who leaves not to them the diſpoſition of his money, or becauſe they have in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect already loſt all, and much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated all their family, finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſily diſpoſed to ſatisfy the criminal paſſions of ſuch as can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them wherewithall to Play? Of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:150342:145"/>what diſorders is not a Woman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable who hath had a conſiderable loſs at Play, and who ſees her ſelf ready to incur the indignation and the fury of a Husband whom her Play hath already driven ſeveral times almoſt into deſpair? And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are there who ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be expreſly overcome by the women with whom they play, upon deſign to corrupt them, and who thus make a ſhameful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous traffick of that divertiſement?</p>
                  <p>And here it is, my Siſter, that I entreat you to make reflexion upon the blindneſs of the <hi>major</hi> part of Fathers and of Mothers who ſuffer their Daughters to game with young men, and to receive from them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable preſents: yea, ſome of them are ſo devoid of reaſon, as to rejoice at their Daughters winnings in theſe occaſions, and to take therein a vain and ſottiſh complacency; not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the jmaginary victory they get in their play flattering their
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:150342:146"/>fancy, renders them ſenſible of the liberality of thoſe young Gallants, and induces them to give them ſome ſignes of their acknowledgement, which turns in the end to the ſhame and to the confuſion of a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p>In effect, Gaming is one of the moſt dangerous ſnares which the Devil lays to entrap young people, and which he ordinarily makes uſe of to make them fall into criminal freindſhips. They play ſometimes one to one; or if they are many, they combine one with another. They take the game from her whom they will oblige, they charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with her loſs, and thus they inſinuate themſelves by little and little into her heart.</p>
                  <p>As they make profeſſion in this age to play only for divertiſement, they affect in Play a certain frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a kinde of liberty to ſpeak any thing, which although it paſſes not abſolutely the bounds of honeſty
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:150342:146"/>and exteriour ſeemlineſs, yet fails not to leave malignant impreſſions. They turn all the events of play in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to idle chatterings: and they take occaſion of all that preſents it ſelf, and of the good humour into which gain puts her with whom they play, to make declarations which would be worſe received at another time when they are more ſerious.</p>
                  <p>They proceed with this diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to walkings abroad and to colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where are made exceſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. There are not wanting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet freinds knowing the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which induces theſe young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to theſe fooliſh charges, and knowing them for whoſe ſake they are made, engage the Mothers to come with their Daughters. Play mixes it ſelf again in this divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and begets a new engagement to a new match and to another treat. And thus there is (as it were) a concatenation of gaming, of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings abroad, of collations, and of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:150342:147"/>divertiſements, which do ſo link to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the hearts of theſe young lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that the Parents finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged at laſt againſt their wills, to cover with the veil of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the engagements they have made to each other, and to which Play, which appeared at firſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, gave the entrance.</p>
                  <p>Behold, Siſter, how the love of Play inſenſibly deſtroys youthfull perſons, and how this paſſion is no leſs prejudicial to Children then to their Parents, making them fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe horrible ſtrayings which I have repreſented unto you.</p>
                  <p>You ought therefore to employ all your care to prevent your Children againſt ſo dangerous a paſſion, and to apply your ſelf timely to inſtill into them ſuch Chriſtian Maxims as may beat it down and deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>You are to make them conceive what uſe they ought to make of their time and of their means, when it is permitted them to take their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:150342:147"/>and with what Plays they may laudably divert themſelves.</p>
                  <p>You ought frequently to inclucate unto them, that one of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous arts of the devil is to perſwade people that the loſs of time is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or at leaſt not criminal: that nevertheleſs time is lent us by God to make good uſe of it, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it faithfully in his ſervice and for his glory, to conquer our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to expiate our ſins, to eſtabliſh us in good cuſtoms, to ſanctify us, and ſo to husband all the hours and all the moments thereof that we may acquire a happy Eternity: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that one cannot, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>without ſleighting the riches of Gods boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without contemning his tollerance and his long patience, and without heaping up,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,) <hi>a treaſure of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the day in which God will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every one according to his works,</hi> employ the time which ought to be to us ſo precious, in vain amuſements, and in barren and vicious occupations.</p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:150342:148"/>
                  <p>You ought to declare unto them, that the Holy Fathers agree in this, that men are only the Depoſitairs and Guardians of the goods which they enjoy; that after they have taken what is needful for their ſubſiſtance, the overplus appertains not to them but to the poor to whom they ought to diſtribute it; and that when they know their neceſſity they ought to cut off even from what is to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neceſſary, to impart it to them.

                     <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to ſay, <q>That all they who know not how to uſe as they ought the goods which they lawfully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, are real Uſurpers of the goods of other people.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You are to make them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that a Chriſtian may not ſeek in his divertiſement any more than a ſimple untiring of his ſpirit and of his body in order to render himſelf more capable to act Chriſtianly; and that accordingly all ſuch diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements as notably prejudice his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:150342:148"/>health, or diminiſh the fervour of his ſpirit, may not be permitted him; and that in general he hath right to no divertiſement whatever, till after an innocent labour, and conformable to the obligations of his eſtate and condition.</p>
                  <p>Finally, you ought to teach them, that there are Plays wherewith they may innocently divert themſelves, but that there are alſo others which they muſt abſolutely avoid: the Plays permitted, are ſuch as ſerve to exerciſe the body and the ſpirit, and in which Art and Induſtry have the principal part: the Plays which are forbidden are ſuch as conſiſt purely in chance and hazard.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſorts of Plays have been at all times condemned by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which would in the firſt regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe made upon this ſubject, have them who thus played, to be ſuſpended from the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. She hath alſo ordained, that the laity ſhould be excommunicated,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:150342:149"/>and the Church-men degraded who ſhould fall into this ſin. Finally, ſhe hath proceeded in the general Council of <hi>Latran,</hi> to forbid Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical perſons to aſſiſt at them, which was renewed in the year, 1524. in the Synod of <hi>Sens:</hi> by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, how the Church in all ages hath abhorred theſe divertiſements, ſince ſhe hath forbidden the very ſight thereof to her Miniſters, and that ſhe ſuffered them not ſo much as to aſſiſt at them.</p>
                  <p>And this is it undoubtedly which obliged an ancient Eccleſiaſtical Authour,
<note place="margin">An ancient Authour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong he works of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                     </note> in a Treatiſe he compoſed againſt ſuch as play at the Plays of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and which is among the Works of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to rank theſe Plays in the number of the ſtrongeſt temptations which the Devil makes uſe of to deſtroy the faithful. He ſays, <q>That the Play of Chance and Hazard is a manifeſt ſnare of the Devil; that it is a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:150342:149"/>mortal and ſubtil Poyſon which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates even to the bottom of the heart, and entirely corrupts it; that the wound it makes in the Soul cannot be cured; that God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mortally offended; that one ſees there nothing but tranſportations without reaſon; that truth hath there no place; that lying reigns there; that it is an obſcurity and a clowd which the enemy ſpreads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men to draw them into preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices; that the devil is preſent at this Play to triumph and to make his profit of the loſs of them who there expoſe themſelves with the ardour which is ordinary to ſuch as love this criminal divertiſement: He calls this ardour a fury and a madneſs. He calls the hands which there play, cruel, becauſe they turn their weapons againſt themſelves, in bereaving themſelves all at once of the goods which their Anceſtours had got together for them with much ſweat and pains-taking. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:150342:150"/>he ſays, that it is a kinde of Idolatry for a Chriſtian to apply himſelf to it, and that the Play of Chance and Hazard is one of the means the devil hath invented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage man to ſacrifice to him his goods and his own quiet.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it only the Church which hath teſtified in her Councils, and in the Writings of her principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, a horrour of theſe Plays of Hazard;
<note place="margin">Laws of Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours againſt Gaming.</note> but Kings and Emperours have alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them.

So true it is that they who made the Civil and the Eccleſiaſtical laws have equally judged the Games of Hazard to be no leſs contrary to good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and to the ſpirit of Religion than to the common good of the State and of particular Families.</p>
                  <p>I know well that by condemning the games of Hazard in general, we muſt not (to do juſtice to each one in particular) ſo ſeverely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſome of them as we do others, becauſe they are not all equally full of hazard; and that for example, the Play at Dice is worſe than certain Plays of Cards, where judgement and induſtry have ſome ſhare. But I alſo know that they all are equally
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:150342:151"/>forbidden to Chriſtians, although they are not all equally evil.</p>
                  <p>There needs no more (to convince them of this Truth who will call it into doubt, than the teſtimony of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of this laſt age who have treated of Caſes of Conſcience and who cannot be cenſured of overmuch ſeverity.</p>

He adds af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, ſpeaking of Play in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that gaming is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a mortal ſin, by reaſon of the circumſtances which accompany it, and that oftentimes one is obliged to reſtore back what they have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as when he who is the loſer had not power to diſpoſe of that he played away, as it falls out with Children or married Women.</q>

For then, (ſays he,) they make a ſhameful traffick contrary to the true end of play, which is to eaſe and refreſh
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:150342:152"/>the ſpirit: and this commerce toyls them more than would a lawful occupation, by the diſquiets which it cauſes in them: He adds, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he will not ſay poſitively, that Lay-people are as ſtrictly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as Eccleſiaſtical perſons to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void theſe Games, yet he entreats them all, and particularly ſuch as are of great quality, to conſider, that if they ſin only venially, yet their fault ceaſes not to be very great; that they exerciſe a traffick no leſs ſhamefull than the gain they make of it; and that they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes bound to Reſtitution; and laſtly, that they cannot without drawing upon themſelves a great confuſion before God, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a great indecency, receive the Sacred Euchariſt, unleſs they are reſolved to abſtain for the future from theſe ſorts of Games.</q>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:150342:152"/>an entrance into his houſe, and makes thereof an Academy for them to play at hazards, ſins very grievouſly, becauſe one rarely plays at thoſe games without mortal ſin, and becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is obliged by the natural law not to furniſh others with the matter and occaſion of ſin.

                  <p>You need only, my Siſter, apply all theſe Maxims to Gameſters, to be perſwaded that very few of them are innocent. The <hi>major</hi> part of them play only at ſuch games wherein chance hath chief ſoverainty, and which by conſequence are forbidden. They play for conſiderable ſums, and which by little and little drain their
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:150342:153"/>purſes or notably incommodate their Family. A Woman thinks her ſelf moderate when ſhe expoſes her ſelf to loſe but forty or fifty Piſtols in an afternoon, not only without the conſent of her Husband, but even againſt his will: and ſhe conſiders not, that ſhe really robs him of all that ſhe plays away, becauſe he is maſter of the Community according to the civil law; and (as ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>)
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 99. <hi>ad Eccl.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe ſhe <q>cannot ſay, I may do what I pleaſe with my proper goods, ſince ſhe may not diſpoſe of her own perſon as ſhe pleaſes, and becauſe ſhe belongs entirely to her Husband.</q> Nor do the Husbands on their ſide render themſelves leſs criminal in expoſing to hazard the goods of their Wives and Children, and in expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

                  <p>As to the games which are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how many are there of them which are not accompanied with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which render them cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal? Do they not ſpend therein whole days and nights: and inſtead of uſing them to divert the ſpirit and to fortify the body, do they not very frequently deſtroy the forces both of the one and the other by the exceſſes therein committed? How ſmall ſoever is the ſum they play for, do they not fall into paſſion? See we not there reigning ſpight, envy, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, wrangling? Do not Pride and deſire to win and overcome, regulate (as one may ſay) all their motions? So that it may be ſaid, that it is a very hard matter to play innocently at any game, and without feeling I know not what alteration, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares either that the Soul is not yet cured of her ſpiritual infirmities, or

                  <p>Endeavour therefore, my Siſter, to educate your Children in an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from all manner of gaming. And as a divertiſement is the moſt ordinary pretext for their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, regulate ſo their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and their heart as to this matter, that they may know how to uſe it as Chriſtianly as they do all other ſolaces which neceſſity forces us to ſeek for.</p>
                  <p>Who would not blame a perſon, who, becauſe he hath need of meat and drink to repair the ruines of his body and to ſuſtain his life, would ſit at table day and night, and make that his whole occupation? they

                  <p>The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.36. <hi>That if a Father thinks it is a ſhame to him to let his Daughter paſs over the time of her youth without Marrying her, and that he judges that he ought to do it, he ſins not, if acting according to his thought he gives her in Marriage. But he</hi> (adds this Apoſtle <hi>v.</hi> 37.) <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not engaged by any neceſſity, and who finding himſelf in a full power to do what he pleaſes, takes a firm reſolution in his heart, and judges himſelf that he ought to conſerve his Daughter a Virgin, does a good work. Thus</hi> (concludes he <hi>v.</hi> 38.) <hi>he who marries his Daughter does well, but he who marries her not, does yet better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:150342:159"/>
                  <p>Where you ſee, Siſter, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though St. <hi>Paul</hi> blames not parents who engage their Children in the World by procuring for them ſome eſtabliſhment by the means of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; yet he prefers the conduct of thoſe who marry them not, and who make a firm reſolution in their hearts to move their Children to renounce the world and thoſe ſorts of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and to embrace Virginity.</p>
                  <p>This great Apoſtle conſidered, <hi>Ib.</hi> v. 25. <hi>That although he had received no command from our Lord which obliged to Virginity; yet it was advantagious to man, becauſe of the wretched neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this preſent life, not to marry,</hi> v. 26.</p>
                  <p>He conſidered, v. 29. <hi>That what time remains is ſhort; and therefore that even they who have wives, ſhould be as if they had none; they who weep as if they wept not;</hi> v. 30. <hi>they who rejoice as if they did not rejoyce; they who buy as poſſeſſing nothing, and they who uſe the world as not uſing it,</hi> v. 31.</p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:150342:160"/>
                  <p>He conſidered, v. 32. <hi>That he who is not married employs his care upon the concerns of our Lord, and of what he ought to do to pleaſe him;</hi> v. 33. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he who is married, employs his care upon the things of the world, and what he is to do to pleaſe his wife, and ſo he findes himſelf thus parted and divided. In like manner that a Woman who is unmarried and a Virgin, hath her ſpirit employed upon things of our Lord,</hi> v. 34. <hi>to the end ſhe may be holy in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and in ſpirit; whereas ſhe who is married, hath her ſpirit employed with ſolicitude upon the things of the world, and caſts about what ſhe is to do to pleaſe her Husband.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe Conſiderations made St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſire, <hi>Ib.</hi> v. 7. <hi>That all men were in the ſtate in which himſelf was, and that they were diſengaged from cares and diſquiets; v.</hi> 32. having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as he declares, <hi>to enthrall them by his words, nor to put upon them any neceſſity, but only to induce them to that which is moſt pure, and which affords
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:150342:160"/>them a more eaſy means to tye themſelves to God without any diſtraction,</hi> v. 35.</p>
                  <p>And it is in this ſpirit that he prayſes the conduct of Fathers and of Mothers, who take a firm reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in their heart to conſerve their Children Virgins, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them in Marriage, foraſmuch as by this means they induce them to that which is moſt pure, and to that which gives them an eaſier means to adhere to God without diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>'Tis this, to which parents are particularly obliged, according to the judicious obſervation of <hi>Gauden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Breſſe.</hi> For this great man after he had declared in one of his Sermons, that parents cannot force the will of their children in what regards the choice of Marriage <q>or the ſtate of continence, adds this prudent reflexion: I will not, (ſays he,) that Fathers and Mothers or the other kindred of Virgins, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Boys or Girls, ſhould flatter
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:150342:161"/>themſelves with that which I ſay, that they ought to leave their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the liberty of this choice, and that they cannot domineer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſpirits upon this account, For 'tis true that they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them a perpetual continence, becauſe that's a thing which ought to be altogether voluntary; but they may, whilſt they are yet young, educate, elevate, and nouriſh their will in the love of that which is moſt perfect; they ought to induce them by their advertiſements and their exhortations to ſuch a love, to enkindle it in them, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in them, and to ſhew much more eagerneſs to engage them in the ſervice of God than in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world; and offering ſome of their Sons to ſerve in the Clergy in the Miniſtery of the Altars, and ſome of their Daughters in the Monaſteries of Religious Women, to the end they may there conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate themſelves to Chaſtity. 'Tis
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:150342:161"/>thus that by adorning the Church with the fruits of a holy Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may attain to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is promiſed in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture to him who hath of his poſterity in <hi>Sion,</hi> and of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  <p>Would to God, Siſter, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had theſe ſentiments graved ſo deeply in their heart, that one might re-eſtabliſh them at this day in the poſſeſſion, wherein they were in the ancient Teſtament and in the firſt ages of the Church, to offer up their children to God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate them entirely to his ſervice, even in their moſt tender years.</p>
                  <p>This power of Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers over their children ſhone glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in the Church at that time in particular when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of Saint <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> flouriſhed moſt in ſanctity.
<note place="margin">Monaſteries of S. <hi>Benedict.</hi>
                     </note> For parents placed their children in theſe holy Schools and in theſe happy Retraits to learn there
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:150342:162"/>the ſcience of Chriſtianiſm and to be there ſafely ſheltered from the malice and from the corruption of the world; and they did it with ſuch a fulneſs of their will, that they ſeemed to deveſt themſelves, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them there, of all the feelings of fleſh and blood, and to renounce entirely all the right they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them. From whence it was that they had a cuſtom, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Rule of <hi>St. Benedict,</hi> to enwrap the hands of the childe in the cloath of the Altar, as it were to ſignify that this innocent youth took God, who is repreſented by the Altar, for his inheritance.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe Riches are one of the ſtrongeſt temptations of the world, and one of the moſt powerful means the world makes uſe of to make it ſelf beloved; the Children were made poor, and were deſtript of wealth for ever. The Fathers could no longer make them partakers of their goods but by giving Alms to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:150342:162"/>the whole Monaſtery: and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to the end they might remain happily engaged to the ſervice of Chriſt Jeſus without hope of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they promiſed with an Oath that they would never re-place them in poſſeſſion of the goods they had now quitted by abandoning the world.</p>
                  <p>This practiſe was yet in uſe in the Eleventh Age, where we finde that the childe who was thus offered wore a Crown, as if he had been already a Religious man, for a mark of the Victory he was going to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over the World: and as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſaac</hi> he carried in his hands not Wood and Fire, but Bread and Wine, to ſignify that he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a thing conſecrated to God, and a living and ſpiritual Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>As in Baptiſm, Parents promiſe for their children, that they renounce the Devil and his Pomps; ſo here the Fathers promiſed before witneſſes, that their children ſhould remain in the regular obſervance of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery:
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:150342:163"/>they proteſted that it was no longer in their power, after this Oblation, to caſt off the Yoak of the Rule to which they were now ſubjected; and they made uſe of that form, which is ſomewhat near the ſame which is ſtill uſed by the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of St. <hi>Benedicts</hi> Order in their Profeſſion: <hi>I promiſe before God and his Saints for this my Son a perpetual ſtability in this Monaſtery, the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his manners, and an entire Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. I promiſe by him who lives eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that I will give him no ſhare in my goods; but that I wholly diſinherit him for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church believed theſe vows of Fathers and Mothers ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to children, that ſhe obliged the ſaid children to obſerve them all their life. There was no difference put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the deſtroying of ones ſelf and the going forth of a Monaſtery, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had made this manner of engagement; and the children had ſcarcely need of any other Profeſſion;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:150342:163"/>than this ſolemn promiſe by which they were conſecrated to God. Whence it is,
<note place="margin">The 4. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Toledo.</hi>
                     </note> that in the 4th Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> it is ſaid, that whether a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is engaged in a Monaſtery by the devotion of his Parents, or by his own choice, he is always obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſtay there, nor is it permitted him to return to the world: And that according to St. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> he who is placed in a Monaſtery by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Mother, is to know that he is bound to remain there the reſt of his life.</p>
                  <p>There was nothing unjuſt nor over-rigorous in this proceeding: but on the contrary, it was full of juſtice and highly advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the children: For if according to the rules of law, a Father may in caſe of extreme neceſſity ſell his ſon, and make him for ever a ſlave to men, in order to preſerve a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life: why ſhall it not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the rules of the Goſpel to the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:150342:164"/>ſame Father to offer his children to God, and to procure for them a true liberty by engaging them to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, upon the deſign of procuring for themſelves as well as for them, an eternal life and happineſs?</p>
                  <p>What is there in this action on the Fathers ſide, which is not holy and conformable to his duty? This Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice being made with a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere intention and with a piety al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diſintereſſed, was it not a convincing proof, that he had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the natural love which Parents have for their children, into a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity totally Divine: that he had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted that ſo common a deſire, which men have to conſerve their Name and their Family, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they have but one only Child, and that they poſſeſs much Wealth: Finally, that he had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe ſo ſweet comforts which Parents feel in the converſation of their own children?</p>
                  <p>On the childrens ſide, is this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:150342:164"/>to Religion to be dreaded? Is not the yoak of Chriſt Jeſus eaſy, and his burden light, eſpecially to children who have not yet been ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with any vice, who have not yet been corrupted by any evil cuſtomes, who from their cradle have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to Virtue, who have been train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Piety, who have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good examples before their eyes, who have ſucked (as one may ſay) together with the Milk, the Rules of Chriſtian Sanctity, and who not knowing the world have had no ſhare in its delights and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities?</p>
                  <p>But however holy and laudable this practice was, we muſt nevertheleſs grant, my Siſter, that the Church hath with great wiſdom limited the devotion of Parents. She hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that what was formerly the effect of a great and ſincere devotion, was ſomtimes ſcarcely any more than an effect of avarice and cupidity: that Parents oftentimes in theſe days
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:150342:165"/>ſought not ſo much, in placing their children in Monaſteries, to give them to God, as to diſcharge themſelves of thoſe children, to render the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers richer and better provided for in the world. And ſo ſhe hath ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by her laws their authority and ſet bounds to their power; becauſe they on the one ſide made it ſerve their ambition, and on the other ſide oppreſſed the liberty of their own Children.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſhe hath not bereaved them of the power to place them in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age in Monaſteries to have them there educated, and to put them in a ſtate by this happy retrait to march on, both more couragiouſly, and more ſwiftly, and alſo with leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towards Heaven, ſuppoſing they have no other end in this action, than his glory and the ſalvation of their children, and that they offer them to Monaſtries in an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their being Religious or returning to the world, as it ſhall
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:150342:165"/>pleaſe God to diſpoſe of them.</p>
                  <p>But in this laſt practiſe, there are two principal things to be obſerved in order to follow therein the ſpirit of the Church. The firſt is, the choice of the Monaſtery: For Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents would be ſo far from procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their childrens ſalvation, that they would endanger their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they took no care in placing them in Religious Houſes, to ſee whether thoſe Houſes are indeed Religious, and whether they there will not engage their children to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their inſtitute by perſwaſions which are altogether humane, and by a ſpirit which is totally oppoſite to that of God: Wherein it is ſo much more important, that Parents ſuffer not themſelves to be deceived, by how much the leaſt negligence would be very criminal before God in a matter of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing which Parents ought to obſerve, is, That when
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:150342:166"/>their children are in a houſe truly Religious and of a ſolid and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed piety, they draw them not forth of it to return to the World, leſt by taking them for a time from Chriſt Jeſus, who demands them to ſanctify them, they ſhould give them to the world, which demands them to corrupt them.</p>
                  <p>I know they want not ſpecious pretexts for this: they ſay, that a true vocation muſt be tried; that grace will triumph amidſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts; that a Reſolution which is from God cannot be ſhaken, either by the life of the world, or by the luſtre of Riches, and that the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Holy Ghoſt, when it is in a ſoul, cannot be deceived by the cunnings of the ſpirit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>But I alſo know, Siſter, that it is ſaid in holy Scripture, <hi>That he who ſeeks and loves danger ſhall periſh in it:</hi> and that conſequently one cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very great blindneſs bring back
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:150342:166"/>into the middle of the world ſuch children as have been holily ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it, and fancy that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſanctified in a Cloyſter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the world could not have force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to corrupt them.</p>
                  <p>God will have us try our ſelves, but not put our ſelves into the hands of the World and of the Devil to try our ſelves: He on the contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to fly from the mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our ſalvation, for fear of falling into their ſnares; to ſave our ſelves in the ſolitude, for fear to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with <hi>Babylon;</hi> and to hide the treaſure which we have found for fear leſt in ſhewing it, the Devil who ſeeks inceſſantly to take his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſhould take it away from us.</p>
                  <p>The Prudence of Gods holy ſpirit cannot be deceived, but it leaves us and abandons us, when we quit his houſe and the place where he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enlightned us, to enter into a place of darkneſs and of crimes.

                  <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had kept his Eyes always ſhut, he would not have had cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to fight againſt, and he would have continued in perfect peace. Wherefore it is to imitate the Devils malice thus to open the eyes of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom the grace of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath rendered innocent, to make them ſee the vanities of the World to engage them in new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, and to bereave them of peace. 'Tis not to try their Vocation, but to make them loſe it: And 'tis ſo far from making the grace of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion triumph in them by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, that it renders it uſeleſs, and extinguiſhes it in their hearts, becauſe it is not given to ſanctify men in the middle of the World, but to make them abandon it.</p>
                  <p>In the times of Perſecution, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:150342:168"/>Prudence taught the Faithfull to fly from the Executioners; and this juſt and humble Fear was the ſource of the ſtrength which the Saints obtained of God to ſuffer the moſt cruel torments, when they fell againſt their will into the hands of their Enemies. Who doubts but that the ſpiritual Perſecutions of the World which corrupt Souls, are more dangerous, and ought much more carefully to be avoided: and that the allurements of pleaſure, that the aboundance of riches, that the pomps and the exceſs of ambition are Tyrants which murder more Souls than the <hi>Nero's</hi> and the <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> murdered bodies?</p>
                  <p>How great then is their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs who are expoſed to this cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? and what an indiſcretion is it in Parents who thruſt their children into this precipice? they were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily hidden and covered in the Cloyſter from the ſurpriſes of their enemies. The continual Prayers, the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:150342:169"/>labour, and the charitable care of the Religious perſons who ſupported them both by their example and by their prayers and by their advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were as ſo many Bucklers wherewith they were ſhielded, and which rendred them invincible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devil: Is it not then to engage them in the combat, after they are bereft of their Weapons and of their Forces, thus to withdraw them from theſe holy places and practiſes?</p>
                  <p>The Pleaſures, the Flatteries of men, the ſpectacles of vanity encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs them. They hear nothing but the voice of Ambition and of Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs. They ſee nothing but what ſhews them the Angels of Satan, which caſt them into blindeneſs, or couzen them by falſe lights. They are in the midſt of the mire, and yet you would have them contract no filth. They are amidſt fires and flames, and you pretend they ſhould be preſerved by a Miracle, like that which preſerved the three young <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:150342:169"/>amidſt the <hi>Babilonian</hi> Furnace.</p>
                  <p>You well ſee, my Siſter, that this pretention is altogether unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that it is in no ſort confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm. Obſerve then inviolably in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of your children whom you deſign to Gods ſervice, the two things I now propoſe unto you: place them in houſes well regulated, and force them not thence upon any pretext whatever.</p>
                  <p>Let the grace of Chriſt Jeſus act in theſe young Hearts, according to the extent of his bounty. Leave them to liſten at leaſure to the voice which calls them. Give them all the time which is neceſſary to diſcern what he demands of them: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you clearly perceive that he calls them not to Religion, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of knowledge and of piety do aſſure you thereof, do not withdraw them; for fear leſt by a falſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or by an over-haſty precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you ſhould pull out of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:150342:170"/>houſe of Chriſt Jeſus one of his ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to expoſe her to the corruption of the world.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if they have not ſufficient courage to ſacrifice themſelves to God, and that they will return back into the world, receive them with that ſweetneſs and charity which you owe them; but ſuffer them not to become the ſacrifices of the Devil. If they could not follow Chriſt Jeſus in the exerciſes of the Religious life, do not ſuffer them ſo far to deſert them as to follow the Maxims of the world. And if they could not put themſelves into an eſtate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the abundant graces and favours which God communicates to ſuch ſouls as totally diſentangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to unite themſelves more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him; do your beſt to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from engaging themſelves in the diſorders which reign in the world, leſt they ſhould draw upon their heads the dreadful effects of his anger and revenge.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>At what age theſe Maxims and theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are to be applied.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS to the time, my Siſter, when you ought principally to reduce into practiſe all theſe Maxims and all theſe advices, it is that time which commonly ſeems leaſt proper for the acquiſition of virtue, and to know its excellence and its beauty: I mean that of Infancy.</p>
               <p>This is that which the holy Ghoſt himſelf inſinuates unto us by the mouth of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who ſays, <hi>Pro.</hi> 32.11, <hi>That one may eaſily judge of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and of the virtue of a young man by the things to which he is affected in his Infancy.</hi> He would ſignify hereby that Parents and they who are enchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Education of children, will be unexcuſable, if the children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not vertuous under their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; ſince they might eaſily prevent
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:150342:171"/>their diſorders by applying wholſome remedies to the firſt acceſſes of their evils, and that they might have weeded out in their tendereſt years the ſeed of all thoſe bad productions, which then begin to bud forth and appear.</p>
               <p>And it is this which <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> declares yet more ſmoothly, when he ſays: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.25. <hi>You have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, inſtruct them and curb them from their Infancy:</hi> Where you ſee Siſter, that Gods holy ſpirit makes an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to trees, and that he will give us to underſtand, that as we prune and bend trees whilſt they are yet young, leſt by overlong delaying it, they may be apter to be broken than bended: ſo children, who in the langage of the Royal Prophet, <hi>Pſal.,</hi> 107.4. <hi>are round about the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their Parents as new Plants of the Olive-tree.</hi> are to enter under the diſcipline of their Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as ſoon as they leave the arms of their Nurſes; and that they are
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:150342:171"/>no leſs to be taught how to march towards Heaven, than they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to go upon the Earth. So that as they are informed to render to their Parents and to ſuch perſons as preſent themſelves before them, the little marks of reſpect and of honour whereof they are then capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, although they know not the reaſons why they ſhould prefer them before others; ſo they are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to render to God little teſtimonies of Piety, and to practiſe weak actions of virtue although they cannot comprehend the obligations they have to his Divine Majeſty, nor the excellence of virtue.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>We are not to expect, ſays St. <hi>John Chryſoſtom,</hi> till our children are great, to imprint fear into them: but we are to regulate them, inſtruct them,

                     </note> and form them from their Infancy, and then they will never need our threats or our ſeverity. We carry
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:150342:172"/>our ſelves towards them in ſuch ſort as if a Phyſitian having ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a ſick perſon whom he ſaw fallen into a languiſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and having preſcribed him no remedies for his cure whilſt they were capable to have their effect, ordains him a great number after the noble parts were corrupted by the diſeaſe, and that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incurable.</p>
                  <p>All the evill we ſee, (ſays he in another place,
<note place="margin">

                     </note>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from our own lazineſs and from our negligence, and becauſe we ſtrive not to inform our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in piety in their moſt tender years: We take much care and pains to have them inſtructed in the profane Arts and Sciences: we procure for them with all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantagious employments in the Court and in the Camp: We hourd up Wealth for them: We get them Freinds: In brief, we do
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:150342:172"/>all we can to render them conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the world, but we take no care to acquire them the favour and love of the King of Angels, nor to make them obtain one day an honourable rank in the Court of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely did parents timely accuſtom their children to the yoak of a holy diſcipline whilſt they are yet young; did they take pains to bring them by little and little to their duty, when they firſt begin to be froward and hard to be ruled; if they ſtrove to cure the diſeaſes of their ſoul when they have not yet taken root, and to pull up their paſſions before they are grown ſtrong, we ſhould have nothing to do with laws, nor with judgements, nor with puniſhments and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>For the Law,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) <hi>is not made for the Juſt:</hi> but becauſe we neglect their Education, we enwrap them in a world of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and oftentimes we our ſelves
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:150342:173"/>deliver them up to the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and throw them headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In Chriſtianiſm it is the Maxim of a wiſe and diſcreet conduct to do all and to omit nothing which may ſtrengthen us againſt the aſſault of vices. But the means, Siſter, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſo holy an enterpriſe, is, in the loweſt age of your children to ſeize upon all the avenues of their ſpirit and of their heart, and to render virtue the abſolute Miſtreſs there, by a prompt baniſhment of every thing which may make there the leaſt vicious impreſſion.</p>
               <p>True it is, that children are not capable to diſtinguiſh virtue and vice, having not yet the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <q>But yet, as a famous Divine obſerves, they may contract accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Idea's and the Fancies which they receive by their parents education, a certain inclination which will much help them or much hurt them, (when coming
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:150342:173"/>to the uſe of their liberty they muſt apply themſelves to vice or to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,) in making a good or bad choice; and (as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſays) that at the ſame time when reaſon ſhall dictate unto them the good they ought to do,
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Baſil.</hi> in his great. R. Rule. 10.</note> the habit and the cuſtom will facilitate the execution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And think not, Siſter, that this is little conſiderable. For if in the judgement of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and ſeveral other Divines, Man is bound by a natural precept and upon pain of Mortal ſin to convert himſelf to God as ſoon as he hath the perfect uſe of reaſon; it cannot be but that which ſerves for a diſpoſition to ſo important an action, muſt be of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſequence.</p>
               <p>What Father is there, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſon to be in danger of looſing his life, or to fall into the hands of Enemies if he paſſes ſuch a way, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours not to put him in ſafety,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:150342:174"/>and to ſecure him from the dangers which threaten him? And what Mother is there, whoſe Daughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loaden with precious Jewells, watches not with much care for fear leſt Robbers ſhould bereave her of them?</p>
               <p>We cannot doubt but that the devil employs all his induſtry to make a childe loſe the grace of his Baptiſm, and that he endeavours to determine him at firſt to make choice of Vice. And ſince he hath no ſtronger Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to conquer us than our own inclinations, can it be doubted but that he will eaſily bring about his deſigne if he findes thoſe of a childe totally inclined to vanity and to the love of Worldly pomps and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures?</p>
               <p>This made St. <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> ſay,
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Greg.</hi> l. 4. <hi>Dial.</hi> c. 18.</note> 
                  <q>That although we are piouſly to believe that the baptized children who dye in their Infancy, enter into the Heavenly Kingdom, yet we ought
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:150342:174"/>not to imagine that all they who can ſpeak are ſaved, becauſe there are ſome of them againſt whom Parents ſhut Heaven gates by the bad Education they give them. The ſame Saint after he had related the dreadful chaſtiſement which God laid upon a Father in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> for having ſuffered his Son of five years old to blaſpheme the name of God, thunders out theſe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing words: 'Tis thus that God would make known to this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Father how highly he was cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and that he would make him underſtand how by neglecting the Soul of this little Infant, he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed a great ſinner for Hells eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames. Theſe are his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this undoubtedly made <hi>Sara</hi> whom the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. propoſes to all Chriſtian Women for their pattern, reſolve to urge <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to drive <hi>Agar</hi> and her ſon out of his houſe; becauſe ſhe feared leſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:150342:175"/>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be corrupted by him, and leſt they ſhould contract bad cuſtomes together. And the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this prudent Woman was ſo juſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.12. that God approved it, having made known to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ought not to oppoſe a deſigne which was ſo diſcreet and ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely even as a ſmall ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which was not perceived in the beginning of a journey, carries one extremely aſtray from the place one intended to go, and as a little breach in a Damm being neglected, cauſes in the ſequel great ſpoils and havocks: even ſo a ſmall evil becomes mortal, if one applies not a prompt remedy; and that which in Infancy was only a ſimple affection for things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, becomes in a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced age a violent love for things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>
               <p>The fair Language of <hi>Graccus's</hi> mother contributed much to his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:150342:175"/>ſays S. <hi>Jerome. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> learned to ſpeak well in his own houſe:
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerom. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Latam.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> could not quit the Vices of a Governour who had taught him in his Infancy, notwithſtanding that he was otherwiſe very powerful, and had conquered the <hi>major</hi> part of the World: which ſhews how hard it is to blot out of the ſpirit of a young man the tinctures it hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Infancy; that it conſerves almoſt always the firſt impreſſions it hath received; and that (as St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> ſays) <q>what one learns in that age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as it were the ſame thing with our Soul,
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Ireneus in ep. ad Florin.</hi>
                     </note> and is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (if we may ſay it) into its ſubſtance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This made one of the moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted among the Pagans to ſay, <q>That one of the things we ſhould chiefly take care of in the Education of children whom we intend to leave a long time
<note place="margin">Quintilian.</note>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:150342:176"/>in their Nurſes hands, is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the chuſing of theſe Nurſes. For, (ſays he,) they muſt be very wiſe: and we ought as far forth as may be to take ſuch as have the beſt qualities, and whoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are beſt regulated. But although we ought principally to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their good conduct, we muſt not omit to examine their way of ſpeaking: For they are the perſons whom the children firſt hear, and whoſe language they ſtrive to imitate: and naturally we retain much more firmly, what we learn in our tendereſt years: juſt as a Veſſel new-made conſerves almoſt ever after the odour of the firſt liquor powred into it. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that even the bad qualities ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here much more ſtrongly, and that Evil makes a deeper impreſſion than good: yea, the good it ſelf eaſily changes into evil, whereas it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom that vicious habits and cuſtoms turn into good ones.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:150342:176"/>
               <p>This alſo made <hi>Plato</hi> ordain, that we ſhould not only endeavour with much care and watchfulneſs to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate children well when they are three years old: but moreover he extremely recommends to Mothers that during the time of their being with childe they ſhould keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free from all ſort of alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and generally he exhorts Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, to exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much as may be from all paſſions; for fear leſt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the bodies of their children ſuch affections as reign in them, they ſhould paſs even to their ſouls; and leſt their bodies being formed of a blood burning with choler, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with an unchaſte Fire, or that being conceived in a boſom fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Pride and Vanity, their Souls ſhould contract inclinations of Fevenge, Impurity and Ambition.</p>
               <p>We alſo ſee, Siſter, that God hath beſtowed very particular Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon ſuch Children as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:150342:177"/>to him in their Mothers womb. <hi>Sampſon, Samuel,</hi> and St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in the Old Teſtament, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in the New, are authentick proofs of the advantages which are derived from this holy practiſe. <q>And it is moſt certain,

And to ſpeak more Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly, whether they who live with great meekneſs and great modeſty, who think only of ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and of ſuffering themſelves to be directed, who eſteem themſelves the laſt of men, and ſeek the leaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable places, who have always
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:150342:179"/>before their eyes the Vanity of the world, and the nothing of creatures; or they who look to be reſpected, and who render themſelves terrible by their injuſtices and by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences; who will command every one, and omit nothing to uſurp the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracies, ſcarcely remembring any longer that they are men, ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are they puffed up with pride, and ſo full are they of ſelf-eſteem and vanity.</p>
               <p>Now if they are theſe later who overturn eſtates, who trouble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who cauſe the murders, the ſlaveries, and all the miſeries which we ſee and lament; and if they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived not at this extremity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, but becauſe their parents neglected their Education: is it not evident that it is the intereſt of Kingdoms, that every Father of a Family ſhould follow the Rules we have propoſed, that ſo by faithfully practiſing them they may bring their children to embrace the documents
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:150342:179"/>of the Fathers of the Church and of the Doctours of the world; and as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, <q>That they may by their care render them ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lights to ſhine amidſt the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which Vices have ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the World, and to ſhew the way of Heaven to ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wretches who go aſtray?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this, Siſter, is the ſecond motive upon which the truth I have advanced is eſtabliſhed, and upon which is grounded the obligation of Parents, to educate, according to the Maxims of the Church Fathers, thoſe Children whom they deſign for the World. For it is certain, that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hath this advantage, to make it ſelf eſteemed by its own enemies, and that if it hath not ſufficient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements and charms ſtrong enough to gain all mens hearts, yet it hath power and ſtrength enough to draw their admiration.</p>

If there is a Judge who will not be corrupted, is he not deſired by all ſorts of perſons to be the arbitratour of their life and fortune? And they who have the leaſt Ambition and the leaſt love for Offices and Commands, are they not (ſays St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>) moſt welcom in the Courts of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Kings and Princes?</p>
               <p>Do not fear that the modeſty of your Daughters in their dreſs, that their reſervedneſs in company, that the little entercourſe they have with young Gallants, will render them leſs eſteemed or leſs ſought for in Marriage. Their ſimplicity, their meekneſs, their affection for ſuch things as concern the good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Family, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of worldly ornaments, will make them better known than ſtrut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and vanity: And if men for their diverſion ſeek ſuch as live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Maxims of the world, they will not have for wives but ſuch
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:150342:181"/>as follow the laws of the Goſpel, ſuch as love retiredneſs, and ſuch as have no inclination to the Modes and Pomps of the World.</p>
               <p>This fidelity to follow the Maxims of the Holy Fathers in the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Children whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne for the World, is it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to purchaſe them the love and eſteem of all people; but it is even more neceſſary for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſouls, than for that of thoſe Children whom they deſigne for Cloyſters and for retrait. The ſole compariſon which St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> makes uſe of is ſufficient to prove this. <q>Even as,

               <p>Now if theſe irreconcilable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mens ſalvation raiſe their ſtrongeſt batteries againſt Children in their tendereſt age: they who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them into the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having taught them in that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age to contemn pleaſures, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Honours, do they not expoſe them naked and unarmed to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the ſaid Enemies?</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore train them up to the combat from their Infancy, diſcover to them the crafts and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their enemies, teach them the means to ſurprize and to defeat them, make them know that it is almoſt impoſſible to conſerve perfect health amidſt the contagion, and that living in the world they muſt

                  <p>This unhappy proceeding is the cauſe that they ordinarily entertain themſelves with nothing but trifles and things altogether unprofitable; that to furniſh matter for converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they examine the actions of their neighbour, they cenſure them and they diſcover their ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known crimes; that all their talk is but a concatenation of detraction, of falſhood, of vanity, and of pleaſure; and that that which ſhould be (as it were) the ſenſible Communion of Saints in Chriſt Jeſus, and the image and expreſſion of the communion and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:150342:185"/>ſociety which we have begun with God and with Chriſt Jeſus by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, 1 <hi>Joan.</hi> 13. becomes a ſource of malice, and is in effect nothing but a ſequel of that miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which our firſt Parents had with the Devil, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. which cauſed the ruine of all their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which rendred all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the children of anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
                  <p>Shall we then wonder that the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> part of the Children of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans live in ſo great diſorders? that they are ſo perfectly knowing in what is neceſſary to frequent compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and to render themſelves plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and that they know ſo little what is neceſſary to go to Heaven and to pleaſe Chriſt Jeſus? that they are ignorant of nothing that concerns the Modes which Vanity and Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have introduced into the World, and that they are ſo ill inſtructed in the Rules of the Goſpel, and in the laws, cuſtoms, and ceremonies of the Church?</p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:150342:186"/>
                  <p>'Tis long ſince, Siſter, that God would have brought a Remedy to this Diſorder.</p>
                  <p>In the law of Nature, he ordained, according to the Tradition we have from S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> that the firſt born of the Family ſhould be exalted to the Prieſthood, that they ſhould be ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated therein by their own Parents, and that they ſhould have no other Doctours and Teachers but them concerning the truths they were to believe and the functions they were to exerciſe. 'Twas for this, that when he was ready to revenge the crimes of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra, Gen.</hi> 26.18. he ſaid <q>that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal this his deſign from <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he knew he would make uſe of this dreadful example to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his children and all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks to walk after him in the way of his Divine Ordinances, and to live holily;</q> giving thereby all Fathers and Mothers to underſtand, that the means to become his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:150342:186"/>friends, and to oblige him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto them his ſecrets, and to conceal nothing from them, was the care they ſhould take to inſtruct their Family.</p>
                  <p>In the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> at the ſame time when God ordained the days of Feaſts and of Solemnities, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Parents to inſtruct their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Ceremonies which were there to be obſerved, and to teach them the reaſons and the motives of their Inſtitution. Thus after he had preſcribed to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> what they were to obſerve in eating the <hi>Paſcall-Lamh, Exod.</hi> 13.8. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to recite to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on that day what he had done in their favour to draw them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and feee them from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Pharoah.</hi> He would have the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles</hi> yearly celebrated, and that they ſhould remain ſeven whole days under Tents made of the branches of Citron-trees, of Myrrhs, of Palms, and of Willows,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:150342:187"/>to the end their children might learn how God had conſerved their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours the ſpace of Forty years in the Deſart under Tents and Pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Finally, he ordained them to offer up unto him all the firſt born of the Males, as well of Men as of Beaſts, to the end that their children being ſurprized at theſe ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſo frequent preſents, might enquire the cauſe and ſo come to be inſtructed of the meaning of theſe Ceremonies, and as the ſacred Scripture ſays, that the Parents might have evermore in their mouths the recital of the benefits they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Gods bounty, and that from thence they ſhould take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to teach their children his Law, and to make them have it in high eſteem, according to that more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Commandement which he gave them in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains them to have his Law in their heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. to entertain their children therein, and to teach them
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:150342:187"/>to meditate upon it, and to think on it in their houſe and in their journeys, during their reſt and during their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and finally in all their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, and at all the hours of the day, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                  <p>In the Law of Grace, the Church which is animated with the ſame ſpirit renews every year the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Myſteries which Chriſt Jeſus wrought for us, and ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to place before our eyes by many ceremonies and ſenſible ſigns the marvails which have been ſo long concealed from the eyes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and whereof they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed but by the Miniſtery of this holy Spouſe.</p>

                  <p>Prevent the Solemnities to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct your children in the Myſteries, the memory whereof are then cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; and accommodate your ſelf to their age to make them enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit and into the practiſe of thoſe Virtues which are honoured in the ſaid Myſteries. Entertain them frequently with the life and actions of Chriſt Jeſus, and repeat often to them what Tradition and the Goſpel teach us of thoſe of his holy Mother.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:150342:190"/>with fear and horrour: relate unto them the conflicts of the Martyrs, the temptations of the Anchorets, the miracles of the Confeſſours: And as there is almoſt no day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church propoſes not to her children a meditation upon the life of ſome Saint; let no Evening paſs without propoſing to them ſome action of Virtue, and without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to them ſome little practiſe of piety for the Morrow.

                  <p>As for example, in the time of the Birth of our bleſſed Saviour, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to them the cold which lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Jeſus endured in the Crib, may you not excite them to ſuffer for his ſake the incommodity of the ſeaſon, and the cold they feel in the School or in the Church?</p>

                  <p>If they complain that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the things they deſire: Why may you not ſay to them; Well, my children, conſider how many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things you have: Alas! our Saviour Chriſt had not a little bed as you have to lye on, nor fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, nor a good Coat to cloath him: He was almoſt naked in a manger and upon ſtraw; and yet all things belonged to him, although he would not make uſe of them, but left them for our uſe and comfort: Is it not then very reaſonable we ſhould want ſome ſmall matter for the love of him? Go, he can and will reward you in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>If they finde it painful to follow you to the Church; tell them, that they are far from doing as our Lord did, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.41. who ſtole himſelf away from his Parents to remain in the Temple, and who made every year a long journey to go thither with them.</p>
                  <p>If they ſhew ſome Impatience in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:150342:191"/>their ſmall ſufferings, ſay to them: Ah, my children, how far are you from enduring the torments which ſo many Saints ſuffered for Chriſt Jeſus? How will you endure Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom when you ſhall be men, if you cannot now endure the pricking of a Pin? And if you cannot bear a little blow from your Brother or from your Siſter, when will you be ſo perfect and patient as to turn your other Cheek to him who hath ſtruck one of them?</p>
                  <p>Inſtill into them a great love and a great eſteem of their own littleneſs and Infancy: Repeat frequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that which is advantagious for Infants in the Goſpel: Tell them how our Lord reprehended his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.19. for hindring ſuch Infants as they are, to come unto him; that he took one of them and placed him in the middle of his Diſciples; and that he ſaid ſeveral times, that one muſt become like them to enter into Heaven. And
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:150342:192"/>thus at the ſame time they grow according to the Body, make them conſerve in their Soul a great love for the qualities and the diſpoſitions of Infancy.</p>
                  <p>Bring them up in a great reſpect and in a great confidence for their Guardian Angels. Let them know principally the life of that Saint whoſe name they bear; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation they have to imitate him or her. And as it is ſaid of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>Matt.</hi> 2. that he grew in the houſe, and under the conduct of his holy Mother, in Wiſdome, in Age, and in Grace before God and before Men; let your children advance by your care by little and little in the knowledge of the ſacred Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in your colloquies and your inſtructions let all things ſerve you, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>to make them encreaſe in Chriſt Jeſus Epheſ.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                  <p>Above all, teach them to prefer God and his Commandements before all other things. Tell them often
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:150342:192"/>that they ought to have for him much more tenderneſs and more reſpect than they have for your ſelf. Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that excellent Mother of whom mention is made in the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who to encourage her children to endure conſtantly their torments for the defence of the Jewiſh Religion, excited them to look upon God as their Father, and to eſteem themſelves happy in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing their lives for the glory of him of whom they received them, and who had prepared lives much more glorious for them in Heaven. Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the admirable art ſhe made uſe of to ſtrengthen the youngeſt of her ſeven children, whom the Tyrant endeavoured to withdraw from the reſolution of dying; and do you, as ſhe did, make uſe of the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch things as you have done for your children, thereby to engage them to perſevere in Virtue: <hi>Take compaſſion my Son,</hi> (ſays ſhe to him,) 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 7.17: <hi>upon a Mother who
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:150342:193"/>hath born you in her boſom, who hath nouriſhed you whole years with the Milk of her Breaſts, and who hath educated you with tenderneſs even till this time: I demand of you, my Son, by all theſe conſiderations, that you will lift your heart and your eyes towards Heaven, and that in imitation of your Brothers you will receive death with joy, that I may have the ſatisfaction to ſee you partaker of their glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis thus, that you ſhould make uſe of the power, which the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the love your children have for you gives you over their ſpirit, to engage them to raiſe up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, and to honour him to whom alone they are indebted for the care you employed in their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And becauſe there are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in this life where the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the reſpect which children have for their Parents may prove a ſcandal to them, and may hinder them from loving and following truth; make them to know that
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:150342:193"/>there is none but God alone to whom we owe an entire ſubmiſſion and without any condition; that there are no perſons, no eſtates, no digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no profeſſion in this life, which we ought not to love with limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that thus they owe you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obedience nor Complacency in ſuch things as would be contrary to the Law of God. Repeat often and explicate unto them theſe words of our Lord: <hi>If any one comes to me, and hates not his Father and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Wife, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his Siſters, and moreover e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his own life, he cannot be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Luk.</hi> 14.20.</p>

                     <hi>Hilary</hi> ſays theſe admirable words: <q>This diſcourſe of Chriſt Jeſus appears harſh, and it ſeems to be a rude and inſupportable precept, to force and engage one to a kinde of impiety towards Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to the higheſt degree of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:150342:194"/>Chriſtian perfection yet God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in this nothing that is harſh, nothing that is not well beſeeming his goodneſs, nothing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his other Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And Fathers and Mothers cannot be offended that he thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains us to hate them, although we owe to them in that quality much tenderneſs and affection; ſince it is alſo enjoyned us to hate our ſelves. Chriſt Jeſus knew that there are many Fathers and many Mothers who have ſuch an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate love for their children, that when they ſee them perſevere in the glory of Martyrdom, they conjure them to yeild to the times, they entreat them to change their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they employ (to weaken them) the motives of a Piety which is altogether irregular. Thus the Hatred (ſays this great Saint) which Children then conceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Fathers and Mothers, is honourable; and it is juſt and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:150342:194"/>advantagious to hate them, who ſtrive to divert us from the love of Chriſt Jeſus,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Avoid therefore, my Siſter, the fault which this Saint reprehends in Parents, and from which they finde much difficulty to defend themſelves, unleſs they have a zeal altogether ſincere and diſintereſſed for their Children. Imitate thoſe Parents of the firſt ages of the Church, who never made ſhew of greater joy than when they ſaw their children ready to be ſacrificed for the defence of Truth and for the cauſe of Chriſt Jeſus. Reade I pray you the Lives of Saints and the Hiſtory of the Church, and you will ſee a great number of theſe Examples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>

After he had breathed forth his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Soul, the noble Mother having embraced him as a holy Sacrifice which ſhe had offered to God, and to which ſhe ardently wiſhed to be for evermore united, carried him home, cauſed him to be buried in her houſe, and poured forth her Prayers almoſt continually over his Sepulchre.</p>

                  <p>And as to what concerns children
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:150342:203"/>in particular, it is to them ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to become like their Parents in their manners, that our Saviour in the Goſpel <hi>John.</hi> 8.39. makes uſe of no other argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Jews, that they were not the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they performed not his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that on the contrary they were the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, becauſe like to him they loved murder and lying.

                  <p>The foundation of this truth is, that children having received from their Parents the beginning and the bud of their own paſſions; if the Fathers and the Mothers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be tranſported in

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:150342:205"/>What will not a childe deſire in his more advanced age, who when he is yet ſcarcely able to go is wrapped in Purple, and knowing not yet how to pronounce a plain word, knows ſcarlet, and can gape after the moſt precious Stuffs? They are taught to taſte the moſt exquiſite Dainties before they can expreſs their deſires. They grow up in Coaches and in Litters, and if they muſt put their foot to the ground, there are ſervants on each ſide to lean upon and to ſupport them. We take pleaſure to hear them ſpeak unſeemly words, and oftentimes they are cheriſhed and applauded for uttering ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and infamous things as one would be aſhamed to hear and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in the moſt debauched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Nor do I wonder at it: We our ſelves teach them: They hear us ſpeak all theſe things: and they ſee what liberties their Fathers take with Women, and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:150342:205"/>their Mothers with Men: Almoſt all our Feaſts reſound with unchaſte Songs; and moſt ſhamefull things paſs in the greater part of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments and Divertiſements.</q> Children accuſtome themſelves to behold and to imitate theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: this cuſtome paſſes into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and theſe unfortunate wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es learn to commit theſe irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties even before they are capable to comprehend their exceſs and their enormity.</p>
                  <p>I think, Siſter, that Chriſtians cannot hear a Pagan diſcourſe thus, without bluſhing that they ſhould have leſs feeling of theſe diſorders than he had; or that they ſhould not make it appear they had better apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereof by their practiſe.</p>
                  <p>Will you then acquit your ſelf well of your Duty, and bring up your children (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ordains) in the Fear and in the Diſcipline of our Lord; live you your ſelf in this Fear and in this Diſcipline. Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

                  <p>IT would be a ſmall matter for a Chriſtian Mother to give holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to her children, to cauſe them to reade good Books, and to practiſe before their eyes what ſhe would have them to practiſe; if ſhe applies not her ſelf ſeriouſly to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and if ſhe endeavours not by little and little to render them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to entertain themſelves with God, and to ruminate in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence what they have been told, what they have read, and what they have ſeen practiſed with edification, that ſo they may reap their profit by them.</p>
                  <p>I know that they have taken up in the world a certain Idea of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prayer, which makes them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it is an exerciſe too hard and too high for many people, and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:150342:207"/>that it is only proper for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have made already a large progreſs and are greatly advanced in the ſpiritual life. They fancy it to be as it were a humane Art, and as an effect of curioſity and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: and as ſoon as one mentions meditation, they repreſent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Methods, diviſions, and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Diſcourſes and thoughts, which require a great contention of ſpirit. Yet ſurely this manner of prayer demands only the Heart: It is the moſt natural occupation of Piety and of Faith, and the proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the feelings one ought to have on the one ſide of Gods greatneſs, and on the other ſide of ones own weakneſs, neceſſitie, and miſery: ſo that the ſimpleſt perſons, and the very children are capable thereof, aſſoon as they begin to uſe their reaſon, and to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their own wants.</p>
                  <p>For in how many different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do they expreſs themſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:150342:207"/>in their very Infancy, to make their Fathers and their Mothers and ſuch other perſons as govern them, underſtand their wants and their pains? How ingenious are they to explicate their joys, their ſadneſſes, their inclinations and their averſions? Make they not uſe of divers crys, of different accents of the voice, and of various motions of the body to diſcover the thought and the deſire of their Hearts? And do they not render with a marvellous dexterity all theſe ſignes as conformable as they can to their wills, to the end they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intelligible? Every thing ſpeaks in their little Body; their Eyes, their Geſtures, their Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and their Tears: Finally, know they not how by an hundred dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways to get what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and even to force them that reſiſt it to yeild at laſt and to grant it them? Why then, as they encreaſe in age, and as their ſpirit
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:150342:208"/>opens it ſelf, may one not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to teach them to ask of God what they ſtand in need of, and to ask it of him in that ſtrong and perſwaſive manner in which the heart knows how to explicate it ſelf and how to make known its affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and its motions?</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> relates,
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 1. <hi>Conf.</hi> c. 9. n. 2.3.</note> that among the exerciſes of his Infancy, having met with certain ſervants of God, <q>who invoked him in their Prayers, and having learned of them (as far forth as he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to frame ſome <hi>Idea</hi> of God) that he was ſomething very great and ſublime, and that although he was concealed from our ſenſes, he could hear our Prayers and help us in our needs; he began (very Childe as he was) to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his aſſiſtance, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf unto him as to his refuge and to his place of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I learned (ſays he, raiſing
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:150342:208"/>up himſelf to God) and taught my ſtammering tongue to invoke you; although I was little, the affection wherewith I prayed you to hinder that I might not be whipped in the School, was not little.—For it is true that I no leſs apprehended the chaſtiſements and the puniſhments which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from my Maſters, than Men apprehend the greateſt torments; and that they beg not with greater inſtance to be delivered from them, than I conjured you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from me theſe torments of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold, Siſter, how advantagious this encounter with theſe men of Prayer, was to this great Saint, and how children in their low age are capable to addreſs themſelves to God, and to demand of him with eagerneſs what they deſire, when they are taught to conceive as far forth as they are able, that it is from him alone they ought to expect it.</p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:150342:209"/>
                  <p>The ſame Saint ſpeaking of a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had in his Infancy, and which they believed had brought to deaths door, attributes the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and the faith wherewith he <q>demanded to receive Baptiſm,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 1. <hi>Conf. chap.</hi> 11.</note> to that which he had heard ſpoken of the eternal life which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us by the myſtery of the Incarnation of Chriſt Jeſus,</q> and to the care his Mother had aſſoon as ſhe had brought him into the World, to cauſe him to be marked with the ſign of the Croſs upon the forehead, and to put him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the number of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecumens. So true it is, that Truth makes very ſtrong impreſſions in the hearts of children, when one knows how to accomodate it to their capacity, and mildely and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to engage them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves before God, and to demand of him grace to love him.</p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:150342:209"/>
                  <p>Thus, Siſter, when children finde difficulty in learning their leſſons, they are to be made to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend as far as they are capable, that Wit and Knowledge comes from God, and that it is to him they muſt addreſs themſelves in the difficulties they have in their ſtudies. When they ſhew any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſion, as a diſorderly love for Play, or an Envy or criminal Jealouſy againſt their Brethren or their Companions, you are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by making them ſee the diſorder of that paſſion, to induce them to demand of God to cure them, and to deſire of him to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more prudent, more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and more charitable. When they ask of you a new Coat or Garment, or any thing of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, teach them to demand it firſt of God, in making them rightly underſtand, that it is from him you have the Money wherewith to buy it; and that if you refuſe them,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:150342:210"/>it is becauſe they have not yet pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it is in this manner, that by cauſing them to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon all the little arts they frequently employ, to obtain what they deſire, or to avoid the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have deſerved, whether it be by proteſting they will be more obedient, or by making a thouſand blandiſhments, you muſt ſtrive to make them conceive how they ought either to demand par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God for their faults, or obtain of him what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true that in order to this, it is neceſſary you ſhould uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards children a kinde of ſweet ſpeech, and ſuch words as are inſinuating, perſwaſive, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, tender, and in brief full of a certain unction, whereof very few perſons are capable. You muſt not tell them theſe things in a dry and harſh manner, nor with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:150342:210"/>and command, but with love and by making your ſelf as it were a little one with them; and you muſt gain their heart to render them capable of an exerciſe which is totally of the heart, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no one is capable, who hath not his heart fixed on God, however clear ſighted and ſufficient he may otherwiſe be. But how ſhould the greateſt part of Mothers, employing themſelves only in worldly affairs, and having their heart divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſo many cares, be capable to inſtill into their children this holy practiſe of Prayer; eſpecially ſince they themſelves moſt commonly can only reade in their Primmers what Prayers they finde there, without ever having applied themſelves to joyn thereunto the Interiour Prayer, which is the Soul and the Eſſence of Prayer?</p>
                  <p>Yet it is this Interiour prayer which is the moſt precious and moſt neceſſary food of Piety. There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:150342:211"/>whereby more to eſtabliſh ones ſelf in the guſt of the things of God, and in the diſguſt of the things of the World: Without this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, all other exerciſes of Piety and Vocal Prayer it ſelf are but dryneſs and languiſhments; and one acquits himſelf of Vocal prayer rather out of cuſtom and by a ſimple convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirit, than by love. This made a famous Authour ſay, that one ought never to divide prayer into Mental and Vocal, as if one could with piety pray Vocally,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellarm. de Orat.</hi> ch. 2.</note> ſeparating it from the Mental prayer.</p>
                  <p>Not but that Vocal prayer is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable when it is well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and accompanied with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. It excites us to recollect our ſelves, and to raiſe our thoughts to God. It advertiſes us and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us what feelings we ought to have in our hearts, and ſerves us (as St.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:150342:211"/>what we ought to ask of God.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is juſt, that we being bound to honour God, according to the Body, as well as according to the ſpirit, we ſhould adore him, and pray to him, by our words and by our voice, at the ſame time we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him by our thoughts and by the application of our heart. But this heart muſt of neceſſity be pure; and to be pure, it muſt be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon God, thereby to make the worſhip of the Body and the exteriour homage which we render him, to be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and holy. Vocal Prayer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:150342:212"/>ought not to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but as far forth as the Prayer of the heart conducts, purifies, and ſanctifies it, and as far forth as it is joyned to it to raiſe it up to the throne of God: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, this Prayer of the heart which is made in ſilence and in Recollection, is all alone very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and very holy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is even more profitable to particular perſons than if there were joyned to it the recital of Vocal Prayers, or then if the noiſe and the elevation of the Voice were there employed; becauſe one teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to God more Faith, and becauſe we addreſs our ſelves to him in a manner more conformable to that which he is and to that which he demands of us, by adoring him and entertaining him only with our thought and with our heart, then if we make uſe of Words. <hi>God is a ſpirit</hi> (ſays our Saviour,) <hi>and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſuch Adorers as adore him in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:150342:212"/>He ſufficiently underſtands our deſires and our demands, although we expreſs them but by our ſole thought: ſo that we ſometimes make our ſelves better underſtood of God by elevating our ſelves to him with all the fervour and with all the extent of our heart, when we are fully recollected and when we employ nothing that is exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and ſenſible, than if we joyn together in our Prayer the heart and the voice, becauſe that may dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our attention, which (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking) muſt be greater and more compleat when one hears nothing without, and when oue ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends all the uſe of ſenſe and of ſpeech.</p>

                     <q>ſhould we rather pray in Recollection and in ſecret than in making a noiſe with our Voice? Hear the reaſon, which we will only draw from an example which is ordinary
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:150342:213"/>among men: If you will preſent a Prayer to ſome perſon who hath a very quick hearing, you do not believe that you need to cry out aloud, but you content your ſelf to ſpeak to him in the tone of an indifferent voice: and we only raiſe our voice to make our ſelves underſtood by ſuch as are hard of hearing. 'Tis not therefore reaſonable to think, that God hears none but ſuch as ſtrive to ſpeak very loud: Such a fancy is injurious to his Omnipotence: But he who prays in ſilence, gives a ſingular proof of his Confidence and of his Faith: He acknowledges, that God penetrates and ſounds the heart, and he teſtifies by praying to him in this ſort, that he doubts not, but that he hears his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before he hath explicated it by Words.</q>

                     </note> (ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in a letter he writ to a holy
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:150342:213"/>Dame touching Prayer,) <q>that God although he knows what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us before we ask it of him, will nevertheleſs have us ask it; if we did not know that what he thus ordains us to do, is not that he may know our will, ſince that cannot be concealed from him, but to enflame our deſires by the inſtance of our prayers, and to render us capable to receive that which he is ready to grant us. For by how much his Preſents are great and magnificent, by ſo much our hearts are little and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to receive them. Therefore the Scripture ſays: <hi>Open your Hearts.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Now theſe ſo excellent and ſo ſublime Goods <hi>which the Eye hath not ſeen,</hi> becauſe they are not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; <hi>which the Ear hath not heard,</hi> becauſe they are not ſounds; and <hi>which are not elevated in the heart of man,</hi> becauſe the heart of man ought on the contrary elevate it
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:150342:214"/>ſelf towards them: theſe Goods, I ſay, ſhall be communicated unto us with ſo much more aboundance by how much we have believed with more Faith, hoped with more Confidence, deſired with more Ardour.</p>
                     <p>'Tis therefore by a continual Deſire, founded upon Faith, Hope, and Charity, that we pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion.</p>
                     <p>But if at certain hours and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times we employ Words in prayer, 'tis only to animate us by thoſe exteriour ſigns to conceive theſe holy affections, to make us obſerve what progreſs they have made in our heart, and to excite us to encreaſe them. For the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our prayer is by ſo much greater by how much the ardour of our deſires hath been greater. So that when the Apoſtle ſays; <hi>Pray without ceaſing;</hi> he intends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we ſhould deſire without ceaſing to obtain that happy life,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:150342:214"/>which is no other than the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bliſſe of him who alone can give it us. If then we demand this of God inceſſantly, we pray inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the cares and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances of the World cool ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our deſires, we recall at certain hours of the day our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to prayer; and we re-place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes by the Words which we addreſs to God this laſt end whether we ought to tend by our deſires; for fear leſt that which begins to fall into Tepidity ſhould paſs into a Coldneſs, and proceed in the end to be totally extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be not re-inkindled by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayers.</p>
                     <p>This being ſo, it cannot be bad or unprofitable to employ much time in prayer, when our leaſure permits it, that is, when it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us not from acquitting our ſelves of other laudable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things to which our duty obliges
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:150342:215"/>us; although in theſe very occupations we ought always to pray by the activity of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
                     <p>For it is to be obſerved, that it is not one and the ſame thing to pray along time or to pray with many words, as ſome imagine; but that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a long and continual deſire, ſince it is written, <hi>That our Lord paſsed over the night in Prayer, and that he prayed very long.</hi> And there is reaſon to believe that he would induce us thereby to imitate his example, he who prayed ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to his Father in the time of his mortal life, and who hears us ſo mercifully with his Father in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                     <p>They ſay, that our Brethren the Hermits of <hi>Egypt</hi> make frequent Prayers, but very ſhort, and that they only lift up their hearts to God from time to time by lively and ardent prayers, without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:150342:215"/>too long upon them, for fear leſt this application and this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſpirit ſo neceſſary in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhould relent or be diſſipated, if this prayer were too continual.</p>
                     <p>This alſo gives us to underſtand that as we ought not to weary and blunt our ſpirit by forcing our ſelves to entertain it in this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour when it begins to ſlacken; ſo we ought not to haſten to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it when we feel it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues: Becauſe, if on the one ſide one ought to banniſh from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ſuperfluity of Words, one ought on the other ſide to ſuſtain it by continual deſires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſo long as the ſpirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres in its application and in its fervour. For to ſpeak too much in prayer, is to employ ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Words to ask a thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and to pray much, is by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and continual motions of the heart to preſs him to whom we pray to render himſelf favourable
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:150342:216"/>to our demands. But oftentimes this paſſes more in ſighing than in ſpeaking; Diſcourſes have not ſo great a part as tears; and then it is, that he whoſe eternal word made all things, makes it appear that they are not the temporal Words of men which are pleaſing to him, but their ſighs and tears.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>'Tis then, Siſter, this prayer of the heart and this entertainment with God which is done in ſilence, in recollection, in the diſengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all exteriour things, and by the interiour ſighs and affections of the ſoul, that Chriſtian Mothers ought to make their Children love and practiſe. 'Tis a Yoak which is good for them to bear from their youth, and as ſoon as they begin to make uſe of their underſtanding and their reaſon: 'Tis a Yoak which repleniſhes the Soul with comfort and ſweetneſs: 'Tis a Yoak which ſuſtains and ſtrengthens, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>What is moſt oppoſite to the Application of theſe Maxims and of theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Chriſtian Education of Children.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are two things particularly which hinder Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from following the Maxims of the Goſpel and the Advices of the Fathers of the Church in the Education of their Children, to wit, <hi>Cuſtom and Ambition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt, although moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, it hath no more lawful foundation than the diſorder of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours and the remiſsneſs of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, makes it ſelf nevertheleſs to be followed by all the world. It gains the heart and the ſpirit of them who moſt reſiſt it: and as S.
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Auguſtin</hi> excellently ſays, it choaks Chriſtians, and ſtifles in them the moſt tender fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:150342:219"/>of piety by the very example of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The Second tranſports the ſpirits of men to ſeek after the goods of the World. It ſerves it ſelf of the natural deſire we have of glory, to make us ſeek it in the eſtate of a high fortune. And at the ſame time when Cuſtome hinders parents from following the Evangelical Maxims in the Education of their children, by inſtilling contrary principles into them, Ambition withdraws them from them by applying all their thoughts and all their affections to the temporal ſettlement of their children.</p>
               <p>Here it is that I pray you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the cunning of the Devil to deceive us, and what art he makes uſe of to deſtroy us. Parents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but labour in the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their children; and it is a feeling which is too natural to them not to be inclined thereto even with ſome ſort of violence. He will not
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:150342:220"/>therefore fight openly againſt it and labour to deſtroy it; but he dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly turns this inclination towards an end which is altogether carnal and terreſtriall; and ſhutting their eyes againſt the lights of Reaſon and Faith, he preſents to them a falſe day-light, which cauſes them to make a thouſand falſe ſteps, I would ſay, which engages them by humane reſpects to follow in the Education of their children the ayr of the World, and the Rules which worldly corruption hath introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>Reſolve therefore, my Siſter, to renounce all that the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and to enter upon thoughts oppoſite to them which the World inſpires into its bond-ſlaves. You will finde no difficulty to follow this counſel, if you reade the 15. and the 17. Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> ch. 15. and c. 17.</note> where Chriſt Jeſus inſtils into his Diſciples ſo ſtrong an averſion from the world, that in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:150342:220"/>good truth I think one cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, and live without trembling in the eſteem and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
               <p>Now when I tell you that you ought to dread nothing more than to live according to the World; think not that I pretend you ſhould (having children) leade a ſolitary life, and break all the cuſtoms which Blood and Friendſhip permit unto you whilſt you live upon earth. 'Tis not that which Chriſt Jeſus demands of a perſon engaged, as you are, in Marriage. I deſire on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that you keep in your diſcourſes and in all your proceedings, ſo great a modeſty, ſo great a reſervedneſs, and ſo perfect a ſweetneſs, that your ſole exteriour may condemn all the Vanities and all the pomps of the World.</p>
               <p>I deſire that entring into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they who are ſo gorgeouſly cloathed may bluſh at your ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that your modeſt dreſs may
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:150342:221"/>give them a confuſion in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
               <p>I deſire that your children may be cheriſhed by all the world by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Innocence and the piety you have inſtilled into them; that all Fathers and all Mothers ſhould envy your happineſs becauſe of their obedience; and that they be not ſought for in Marriage but becauſe of their Virtue and their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</p>
               <p>Finally, I deſire that your houſe ſhould be ſo well regulated, and your domeſticks ſo well inſtructed, that all things with you may breathe nothing but Piety and Honeſty: and (as St.
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi>
                  </note>

               <p>For this end, Siſter, you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetter your ſelf by little and little from all creatures, not ſtudying to ſcrape up wealth for your children;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:150342:221"/>you muſt not rob the poor of their due to content your covetouſneſs and to bereave your Children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God who is their true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>If our Lord himſelf builds not a Houſe, in vain</hi> (ſays the prophet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1.) <hi>they labour who ſtrive to raiſe it up. To raiſe it extremely high is to ſeek its ruine, Prov.</hi> 17.17. <hi>And he who governs himſelf by a ſpirit of Avarice troubles and overthrows his houſe, Prov.</hi> 15.27. And if (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) 'tis God who makes the poor and who makes the rich;
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug. ho.</hi> 48</note> why ſhould you ſo much diſquiet your ſelf for your Children? Why ſhould you not have a confidence in his providence? Why ſhould you not employ all your cares to render them gratefull to him, and a part of your means to procure for them Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours and Freinds near his Divine Majeſty, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9.</p>
               <p>For the reſt, Siſter, although God ſhould give you grace to obſerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:150342:222"/>in the education of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren all that we have here repreſented unto you, and that you ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſelf totally to inſtill into them the Maxims of the Goſpel and of the Fathers of the Church, and to imprint in them a horrour of all that is contrary thereunto: You are nevertheleſs to leave the event en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to God, committing to his Wiſdom and to his Goodneſs to make your ſolicitudes profitable to your Children.</p>
               <p>For as you ought to look only on his Glory in the pains you take to educate them according to the Laws of the Goſpel; if he ſuffers you to be fruſtrated in ſome of them of the fruit of your labour, and that they ſhould neglect all the good feelings which you have endevoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil into them, to abandon themſelves to the paſſions and to the diſorders which reign in the World: you ought in this to ſubmit your ſelf to his holy Will, as in every thing elſe,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:150342:222"/>and to beware of ſuffering your ſelf to be tranſported to any words of murmure, or to believe that God had not accepted your cares and your pains; ſince nothing will happen to you in this, which he hath not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to befall many Saints.</p>
               <p>Finally, I obſerve in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that the <hi>major</hi> part of them who have been particularly favoured of God, have all of them received diſpleaſure in ſome of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

                  <hi>Ammon</hi> his eldeſt Son committed an Inceſt with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Thamar: Abſalon,</hi> his ſecond Son, ſlew <hi>Ammon</hi> at a banquet, to revenge the injury done to his Siſter: and this Wretch having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the friendſhip of his Father, ſtudied ſecretly to raiſe the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: then openly declaring himſelf and taking arms, forced him to fly from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> abuſed his Wives in the ſight of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had the inſolence to purſue him with his weapons in his hand, and to give him battle.</p>
               <p>Now if you deſire to know why God permitted that theſe great men, for whom he had done ſo many wonders, and to whom he had teſtified ſo great love, received not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch ſenſible diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from their children, and that theſe children did ſo ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from the Virtue and the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:150342:225"/>piety of their parents; it is eaſy to anſwer you, that it is to teach Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers who have not the merit of theſe ſo illuſtrious men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that they are indebted only to Gods grace, that their children cauſe not to them the ſame diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and that it would little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail them to have applied themſelves with much care to the education of their children if he did not bleſs their endeavours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the greateſt tryall which can befall a Chriſtian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and which God makes uſe of to prove his fidelity and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the orders of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is to permit his children to fail in their duties and in what they are bound to render to God; and that thus Fathers and Mothers ought to diſpoſe themſelves to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port theſe ſorts of afflictions and tryalls, how hard ſoever they be with Chriſtian diſpoſitions,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:150342:225"/>when he ſhall pleaſe to ſend them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as it is a matter of great difficulty not to commit ſome fault, either in the manner of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their children, or in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much indulging them, or finally, in being too much tyed to them in a humane way; God according to the immutable order of his Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who puniſhes us by the ſame things whereby we have offended him, makes uſe of children to chaſtiſe Fathers and Mothers for the faults they have committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their conſideration. Thus God puniſhed the incontinence of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by taking out of the world the Son he had by <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> and revenged afterwards the Adultery committed by him in ſecret with this Woman, by the abuſe which <hi>Abſalon</hi> made of his wives in the open ſight of all his people.</p>
               <p>Finally, God permits that parents ſhould receive diſpleaſure from their
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:150342:226"/>children, not only to humble them, and to try their fidelity, and to puniſh the faults they may have committed in their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but furthermore to purify the rational affection they have for them, and to teach them to love them, not becauſe of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they finde in the ſubmiſſion and the reſpect they render them, but becauſe they belong to God. For God will have them accuſtom themſelves to look upon him alone in all they do for their children, and to ſurmount all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which occur in the deſigne they have to bring them to his ſervice, even to ſuffer patiently the contempt they make of their advertiſements; and to purſue them by the example of St. <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">St. <hi>Monica.</hi>
                  </note> in ſpight of all their reſiſtance, till God hath touched their heart, and till they have obtained their converſion by their tears and by their perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:150342:226"/>as that Saint obtained it for St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will perchance tell me that I exact great things of you; that I demand you ſhould do all your actions in a ſpirit of Piety and Zeal for the intereſts of God; that you ſhould be perpetually employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to procure his glory in the children he ſhall pleaſe to give you; and that by conſequence I engage you to a continual Prayer, ſince I propoſe unto you a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and Maxims which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep without being powerfully ſupported by him whoſe help we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by humble prayer.</p>
               <p>All this is true, Siſter, and I aver that to acquit your ſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily of the obligation you have to give your Children an entirely Chriſtian Education; you are to follow in this Education the Maxims of the ſacred Scripture, and the Advices of the Fathers of the Church; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them from their tender Infancy to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:150342:227"/>them particularly whom you de ſign to live in the World; to embrace the means which may enable you in this generous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; to overcome the oppoſitions which you ſhall meet therein; and to imitate perfectly the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Idea's of the holy Education I have here traced to you in the conduct of God, and that of his Church; I avouch, I ſay, that to acquit your ſelf worthily of all theſe Duties, you ſtand in need of very powerful Graces, and you ought to live in a continual ſearch and in a profound adoration of the deſignes of God upon your Children.</p>
               <p>You are very inſtantly to crave of him the uſe of his Lights to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; you are to abandon your ſelf to his ſpirit for the choice of ſuch ſentiments and feelings as you ought to inſtill into them, and of the times when your chaſtiſements
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:150342:227"/>and your inſtructions will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto them; and you muſt pray unto him; that ſince <hi>he who plants and he who waters is nothing,</hi> he himſelf will give virtue to your Words, that he will engrave in their hearts his Fear and his Love; and that as he would make uſe of you to give them the Life of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to employ your cares to procure that of their Soul by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, he will alſo make uſe of you to: conſerve and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in them his Spirit and his grace.</p>
               <p>To conclude, you are to propoſe to your ſelf the attaining of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high perfection, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiſe of all the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Virtues; and to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the whole world by the Chriſtian Education of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that you engaged not your ſelf in Marriage upon humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, or upon any other ſcore unworthy of Chriſtianiſm;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:150342:228"/>but (to make uſe of the terms of St.
